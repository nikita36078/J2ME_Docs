<P>
The <code>Canvas</code> class is a base class for writing applications that
 need to handle low-level events and to issue graphics calls for drawing to
 the display. Game applications will likely make heavy use of the
 <code>Canvas</code> class. From an application development perspective, the
 <code>Canvas</code> class is interchangeable with standard
 <code>Screen</code> classes, so an application may mix and match
 <code>Canvas</code> with high-level screens as needed. For example, a List
 screen may be used to select the track for a racing game, and a
 <code>Canvas</code> subclass would implement the actual game.

 <P>
 The <code>Canvas</code> provides the developer with methods to handle
 actions, key events, and pointer events (if supported by the device). Methods
 are also provided to identify the device's capabilities and mapping of keys
 to actions. The key events are reported with respect to
 <em>key codes</em>, which are directly bound to concrete keys on the
 device, use of which may hinder portability. Portable applications should use
 actions instead of key codes.
 </p>

 <p>
 Like other subclasses of <code>Displayable</code>, the <code>Canvas</code>
 class allows the application to register a listener for commands. Unlike
 other <code>Displayables</code>, however, the <code>Canvas</code> class
 requires applications to subclass it in order to use it. The
 <code>paint()</code> method is declared <code>abstract</code>, and so
 the application <em>must</em> provide an implementation in its subclass.
 Other event-reporting methods are not declared <code>abstract,</code> and
 their default implementations are empty (that is, they do nothing). This
 allows the application to override only the methods that report events in
 which the application has interest.
 </p>

 <p>
 This is in contrast to the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Screen.html" title="class in javax.microedition.lcdui"><CODE>Screen</CODE></A> classes, which allow the
 application to define listeners and to register them with instances of the
 <code>Screen</code> classes. This style is not used for the
 <code>Canvas</code> class, because several new listener interfaces would
 need to be created, one for each kind of event that might be delivered. An
 alternative would be to have fewer listener interfaces, but this would
 require listeners to filter out events in which they had no interest.
 </p>

 <P>
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/CanvasItem.html" title="class in javax.microedition.lcdui"><CODE>CanvasItem</CODE></A> subclasses, such as a <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/TextEditor.html" title="class in javax.microedition.lcdui"><CODE>TextEditor</CODE></A>, may be drawn on
 <code>Canvas</code> or <code>CustomItem</code>. See <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/CanvasItem.html" title="class in javax.microedition.lcdui"><CODE>CanvasItem</CODE></A> and
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/TextEditor.html" title="class in javax.microedition.lcdui"><CODE>TextEditor</CODE></A> for more details.
 </P>

 <a name="keyevents"></a>
 <h3>Key Events</h3>

 <p>
 Applications receive keystroke events in which the individual keys are named
 within a space of <em>key codes</em>. Every key for which events are
 reported to MIDP applications is assigned a key code. The key code values are
 unique for each hardware key unless two keys are obvious synonyms for each
 other. MIDP defines the following key codes: <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#KEY_NUM0"><CODE>KEY_NUM0</CODE></A>,
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#KEY_NUM1"><CODE>KEY_NUM1</CODE></A>, <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#KEY_NUM2"><CODE>KEY_NUM2</CODE></A>,
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#KEY_NUM3"><CODE>KEY_NUM3</CODE></A>, <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#KEY_NUM4"><CODE>KEY_NUM4</CODE></A>,
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#KEY_NUM5"><CODE>KEY_NUM5</CODE></A>, <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#KEY_NUM6"><CODE>KEY_NUM6</CODE></A>,
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#KEY_NUM7"><CODE>KEY_NUM7</CODE></A>, <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#KEY_NUM8"><CODE>KEY_NUM8</CODE></A>,
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#KEY_NUM9"><CODE>KEY_NUM9</CODE></A>, <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#KEY_STAR"><CODE>KEY_STAR</CODE></A>, and
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#KEY_POUND"><CODE>KEY_POUND</CODE></A>.

 (These key codes correspond to keys on a ITU-T standard telephone keypad.)
 Other keys may be present on the keyboard, and they will generally have key
 codes distinct from those list above. In order to guarantee portability,
 applications should use only the standard key codes.
 </p>

 <p>
 The standard key codes' values are equal to the Unicode encoding for the
 character that represents the key. If the device includes any other keys that
 have an obvious correspondence to a Unicode character, their key code values
 should equal the Unicode encoding for that character. For keys that have no
 corresponding Unicode character, the implementation must use negative values.
 Zero is defined to be an invalid key code. It is thus possible for an
 application to convert a keyCode into a Unicode character using the following
 code:
 </p>

 <pre><code>
 if (keyCode &gt; 0) {
  char ch = (char) keyCode;
  // ...
 }
 </code></pre>

 <p>
 This technique is useful only in certain limited cases. In particular, it is
 not sufficient for full textual input, because it does not handle upper and
 lower case, keyboard shift states, and characters that require more than one
 keystroke to enter. For textual input, applications should always use
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/TextBox.html" title="class in javax.microedition.lcdui"><CODE>TextBox</CODE></A> or <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/TextField.html" title="class in javax.microedition.lcdui"><CODE>TextField</CODE></A> objects.
 </p>

 <p>
 It is sometimes useful to find the <em>name</em> of a key in order to
 display a message about this key. In this case the application may use the
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#getKeyName(int)"><CODE>getKeyName()</CODE></A> method to find a key's name.
 </p>

 <a name="gameactions"></a>
 <h3>Actions (aka Game Actions)</h3>
 <p>
 Portable applications that need soft key and arrow events and action-related events
 should use <em>actions</em> in preference to key codes and key names.
 Soft key codes are mapped to actions defined by
 exact placement values as specified for the
 <a href="Display.html#exactplacement">Exact placement of Commands</a>.
 Navigation and game keys are mapped to the actions: <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#UP"><CODE>UP</CODE></A>, <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#DOWN"><CODE>DOWN</CODE></A>,
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#LEFT"><CODE>LEFT</CODE></A>, <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#RIGHT"><CODE>RIGHT</CODE></A>, <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#FIRE"><CODE>FIRE</CODE></A>,
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#GAME_A"><CODE>GAME_A</CODE></A>, <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#GAME_B"><CODE>GAME_B</CODE></A>, <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#GAME_C"><CODE>GAME_C</CODE></A>,
 and <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#GAME_D"><CODE>GAME_D</CODE></A>.
 </P>

 <P>
 Each key code may be mapped to at most one action. However, an
 action may be associated with more than one key code. The application can
 translate a key code into an action using the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#getGameAction(int)"><CODE>getGameAction(int keyCode)</CODE></A> method, and it can translate an action into a
 key code using the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#getKeyCode(int)"><CODE>getKeyCode(int gameAction)</CODE></A>
 method. There may be multiple keycodes associated with a particular
 action, but <code>getKeyCode</code> returns only one of them. Supposing
 that <code>g</code> is a valid action and <code>k</code> is a valid
 key code for a key associated with a action, consider the following
 expressions:
 </p>

 <pre>
  g == getGameAction(getKeyCode(g))     // (1)
  k == getKeyCode(getGameAction(k))     // (2)
 </pre>

 <p>
 Expression (1) is <em>always</em> true. However, expression (2) might be
 true but is <em>not necessarily</em> true.
 </p>

 <p>
 Portable applications that are interested in using actions should
 translate every key event into an action by calling the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#getGameAction(int)"><CODE>getGameAction()</CODE></A> method and then testing the result. For
 example, on some devices the actions <code>UP</code>,
 <code>DOWN</code>, <code>LEFT</code> and <code>RIGHT</code> may be
 mapped to 4-way navigation arrow keys. In this case,<code>
 getKeyCode(UP)</code>
 would return a device-dependent code for the up-arrow key. On other devices,
 a possible mapping would be on the number keys <code>2</code>,
 <code>4</code>, <code>6</code> and <code>8</code>. In this case,
 <code>getKeyCode(UP)</code> would return <code>KEY_NUM2</code>. In both
 cases, the <code>getGameAction()</code> method would return the
 <code>LEFT</code> action when the user presses the key that is a
 &quot;natural left&quot; on her device.
 </P>

 <P>
 The implementation is not allowed to change the mapping of actions and
 key codes during execution of the application. However, if the device keypad
 can be used in different modes, and some modes restrict
 user access to certain keys, or if the device has several different keypads
 that are not meant to used simultaneously, a mobile handset implementation is
 NOT REQUIRED to ensure that the mapping between key codes and action
 does not change during the execution of the application. Consequently, applications
 should use the <code>getGameAction()</code> method to determine which
 action is associated with a given key code. It is recommended that applications
 avoid using the <code>getKeyCode()</code> method to determine which key
 is assigned to a specific action.
 </p>
 <a name="commands"></a>
 <h3>Commands</h3>

 <p>
 It is also possible for the user to issue <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Command.html" title="class in javax.microedition.lcdui"><CODE>Commands</CODE></A> when a
 Canvas is current. <code>Commands</code> are mapped to keys and menus in a
 device-specific fashion. For some devices the keys used for commands may
 overlap with the keys that will deliver key code events to the canvas. If
 this is the case, the device will provide a means transparent to the
 application that enables the user to select a mode that determines whether
 these keys will deliver commands or key code events to the application. When
 the <code>Canvas</code> is in normal mode (see <a href="#fullscreen">below</a>),
 the set of key code events available to a canvas will not change depending
 upon the number of commands present or the presence of a command listener.
 When the <code>Canvas</code> is in full-screen mode, if there is no command
 listener present, the device MUST deliver key code events for keys
 that would otherwise be reserved for delivery of commands. Game developers
 should be aware that access to commands will vary greatly across devices, and
 that requiring the user to issue commands during game play may have a great
 impact on the ease with which the game can be played.
 </p>

 <a name="eventdelivery"></a>
 <h3>Event Delivery</h3>

 <P>
 The <code>Canvas</code> object defines several methods that are called by
 the implementation. These methods are primarily for the purpose of delivering
 events to the application, and so they are referred to as
 <em>event delivery</em> methods. The set of methods is:
 </p>

 <ul>
 <li> <code>showNotify()</code> </li>
 <li> <code>hideNotify()</code> </li>
 <li> <code>keyPressed()</code> </li>
 <li> <code>keyRepeated()</code> </li>
 <li> <code>keyReleased()</code> </li>
 <li> <code>pointerPressed()</code> </li>
 <li> <code>pointerDragged()</code> </li>
 <li> <code>pointerReleased()</code> </li>
 <li> <code>paint()</code> </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
 These methods are all called serially. That is, the implementation will never
 call an event delivery method before a prior call to <em>any</em> of the
 event delivery methods has returned. The <code>serviceRepaints()</code>
 method is an exception to this rule, as it blocks until <code>paint()</code>
 is called and returns. This will occur even if the application is in the
 midst of one of the event delivery methods when it calls
 <code>serviceRepaints()</code>.
 </p>

 <p>
 The <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Display.html#callSerially(java.lang.Runnable)"><CODE>Display.callSerially()</CODE></A> method can be used to
 serialize some application-defined work with the event stream. For further
 information, see the <a href="package-summary.html#events">Event Handling</a>
 and <a href="package-summary.html#concurrency">Concurrency</a> sections of
 the package summary.
 </p>

 <p>
 The key-related, pointer-related, and <code>paint()</code> methods will
 only be called while the <code>Canvas</code> is actually visible on the
 output device. These methods will therefore only be called on this
 <code>Canvas</code> object only after a call to <code>showNotify()</code>
 and before a call to <code>hideNotify()</code>. After
 <code>hideNotify()</code> has been called, none of the key, pointer, and
 <code>paint</code> methods will be called until after a subsequent call to
 <code>showNotify()</code> has returned. A call to a <code>run()</code>
 method resulting from <code>callSerially()</code> may occur irrespective of
 calls to <code>showNotify()</code> and <code>hideNotify()</code>.
 </p>

 <p>
 The <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#showNotify()"><CODE>showNotify()</CODE></A> method is called prior to the
 <code>Canvas</code> actually being made visible on the display, and the
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#hideNotify()"><CODE>hideNotify()</CODE></A> method is called after the
 <code>Canvas</code> has been removed from the display. The visibility state
 of a <code>Canvas</code> (or any other <code>Displayable</code> object)
 may be queried through the use of the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Displayable.html#isShown()"><CODE>Displayable.isShown()</CODE></A> method. The change in visibility state of a
 <code>Canvas</code> may be caused by the application management software
 moving <code>MIDlets</code> between foreground and background states, or by
 the system obscuring the <code>Canvas</code> with system screens. Thus, the
 calls to <code>showNotify()</code> and <code>hideNotify()</code> are not
 under the control of the <code>MIDlet</code> and may occur fairly
 frequently. Application developers are encouraged to perform expensive setup
 and teardown tasks outside the <code>showNotify()</code> and
 <code>hideNotify()</code> methods in order to make them as lightweight as
 possible.
 </p>

 <a name="fullscreen"></a>
 <P>
 A <code>Canvas</code> can be in normal mode or in full-screen mode. In
 normal mode, space on the display may be occupied by command labels, a title,
 and a ticker. By setting a <code>Canvas</code> into full-screen mode, the
 application is requesting that the <code>Canvas</code> occupy as much of
 the display space as is possible. In full-screen mode, the title and ticker
 are not displayed even if they are present on the <code>Canvas</code>, and
 <code>Commands</code> may be presented using some alternative means (such
 as through a pop-up menu). Note that the implementation may still consume a
 portion of the display for things like status indicators, even if the
 displayed <code>Canvas</code> is in full-screen mode. In full-screen mode,
 although the title is not displayed, its text may still be used for other
 purposes, such as for the title of a pop-up menu of <code>Commands</code>.
 </P>

 <P>
 <code>Canvas</code> objects are in normal mode by default. The normal vs.
 full-screen mode setting is controlled through the use of the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#setFullScreenMode(boolean)"><CODE>setFullScreenMode(boolean)</CODE></A> method.
 </P>

 <P>
 Calling <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#setFullScreenMode(boolean)"><CODE>setFullScreenMode(boolean)</CODE></A> may result in
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#sizeChanged(int, int)"><CODE>sizeChanged()</CODE></A> being called. The default
 implementation of this method does nothing. The application can override this
 method to handle changes in size of available drawing area.
 </p>

 <P>
 <strong>Note:</strong> As mentioned in the &quot;Specification
 Requirements&quot; section of the overview, implementations must provide the
 user with an indication of network usage. If the indicator is rendered on
 screen, it must be visible when network activity occurs, even when the
 <code>Canvas</code> is in full-screen mode.

<DL>
<DD>Renders the <code>Canvas</code>. The application must implement this
 method in order to paint any graphics.

 <p>
 The <code>Graphics</code> object's clip region defines the area of the
 screen that is considered to be invalid. A correctly-written
 <code>paint()</code> routine must paint <em>every</em> pixel within
 this region, unless the paint mode has been set to transparent (see Canvas.setPaintMode).
 This is necessary because the implementation is not required
 to clear the region prior to calling <code>paint()</code> on it. Thus,
 failing to paint every pixel may result in a portion of the previous
 screen image remaining visible.
 </p>

 <p>
 Applications <em>must not</em> assume that they know the underlying
 source of the <code>paint()</code> call and use this assumption to
 paint only a subset of the pixels within the clip region. The reason is
 that this particular <code>paint()</code> call may have resulted from
 multiple <code>repaint()</code> requests, some of which may have been
 generated from outside the application. An application that paints only
 what it thinks is necessary to be painted may display incorrectly if the
 screen contents had been invalidated by, for example, an incoming
 telephone call.
 </p>

 <p>
 Operations on this graphics object after the <code>paint()
 </code>call
 returns are undefined. Thus, the application <em>must not</em> cache
 this <code>Graphics</code> object for later use or use by another
 thread. It must only be used within the scope of this method.
 </p>

 <p>
 The implementation may postpone visible effects of graphics operations
 until the end of the paint method.
 </p>

 <p>
 The contents of the <code>Canvas</code> are never saved if it is hidden
 and then is made visible again. Thus, shortly after
 <code>showNotify()</code> is called, <code>paint()</code> will always
 be called with a <code>Graphics</code> object whose clip region
 specifies the entire displayable area of the <code>Canvas</code>.
 Applications <em>must not</em> rely on any contents being preserved
 from a previous occasion when the <code>Canvas</code> was current. This
 call to <code>paint()</code> will not necessarily occur before any
 other key or pointer methods are called on the <code>Canvas</code>.
 Applications whose repaint recomputation is expensive may create an
 offscreen <code>Image</code>, paint into it, and then draw this image
 on the <code>Canvas</code> when <code>paint()</code> is called.
 </p>

 <P>
 The application code must never call <code>paint()</code>; it is
 called only by the implementation.

 The <code>Graphics</code> object passed to the <code>paint()</code>
 method has the following properties:

 <p>In addition to the causes listed in
 <code>Displayable.sizeChanged</code>, a size change can occur on a
 <code>Canvas</code> because of a change between normal and
 full-screen modes.</p>

 <p>If the size of a <code>Canvas</code> changes while it is
 actually visible on the
 display, it may trigger an automatic repaint request.  If this occurs,
 the call to <code>sizeChanged</code> will occur prior to the call to
 <code>paint</code>.  If the <code>Canvas</code> has become smaller, the
 implementation may choose not to trigger a repaint request if the
 remaining contents of the <code>Canvas</code> have been
 preserved.  Similarly, if
 the <code>Canvas</code> has become larger, the implementation
 may choose to trigger
 a repaint only for the new region.  In both cases, the preserved
 contents must remain stationary with respect to the origin of the
 <code>Canvas</code>.  If the size change is significant to the
 contents of the
 <code>Canvas</code>, the application must explicitly issue a
 repaint request for the
 changed areas.  Note that the application's repaint request should not
 cause multiple repaints, since it can be coalesced with repaint
 requests that are already pending.</p>

 <p>If the size of a <code>Canvas</code> changes while it is not
 visible, the
 implementation may choose to delay calls to <code>sizeChanged</code>
 until immediately prior to the call to <code>showNotify</code>.  In
 that case, there will be only one call to <code>sizeChanged</code>,

 Canvas.</p>

 <p>In this example, the opaque paint mode is used and the paint method
 renders a white background and black text, thus fully obscuring the
 device's background wallpaper: </p>

 <code><pre>
 paint(Graphics g) {
     g.setColor(0xFFFFFF);
     g.fillrect(0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight());
     g.setColor(0x000000);
     g.drawString("Some Text", 10, 10, Graphics.TOP + Graphics.LEFT);
 }
 </pre></code>

 <p>If the paint mode is <em>transparent</em>, the implementation is
 responsible for appropriately filling the entire clip region prior to
 calling the <code>paint</code> method.  Some devices may
 fill the pixels to a suitable background color, while others may fill
 them with a suitable background image.  Hence, any pixels untouched
 by the <code>paint</code> method will be colored appropriately.  In
 this mode, the <code>paint</code> method does not need to render every
 pixel within the clip region; it should render only those pixels within
 the clip region that it wishes to control the contents of.  By rendering
 a subset of the pixels in this manner, the contents of the Canvas will
 appear rendered on top of the background content provided
 by the implementation.</p>

 <p>In this example, the transparent paint mode is used and the paint
 method renders only the black text, thus making it appear on top of the
 device's background wallpaper: </p>

 <code><pre>
 paint(Graphics g) {
     g.setColor(0x000000);
     g.drawString("Some Text", 10, 10, Graphics.TOP + Graphics.LEFT);
 }
 </pre></code>

 <p>The paint mode is opaque by default.</p>

<DL>
<DD>Sets a key listener for key events to this Canvas, replacing any previous
 KeyListener. A null reference is allowed and has the effect of
 removing any existing listener.

 The set of key delivery methods of Canvas (keyPressed(), keyRepeated()
 and keyReleased()) MUST work even if a KeyListener has been set, however
 the application should use only one of the ways to listen to key events.

 The method call order of Canvas methods and KeyListener methods is
 undefined.

<PRE>
public void <B>setRequiredActions</B>(int&nbsp;actionSet)</PRE>
<DL>
<DD>Specifies the set of actions that must be available on touch screen devices while this
 Canvas is current on the foreground Display.

 All MIDP devices MUST support basic actions (<code>UP</code>, <code>DOWN</code>,
 <code>LEFT</code>, <code>RIGHT</code>, and <code>FIRE</code>) and MAY provide support
 for additional actions (<code>GAME_A</code>, <code>GAME_B</code>, <code>GAME_C</code>,
 and <code>GAME_D</code>).  On touch screen devices, some or all of these actions may be
 provided using an on-screen keypad, and this method may be used to specify the specific set
 of actions required, thereby permitting the implementation to optimize the size of the
 on-screen keypad.  Calls to this method should be ignored by keypad devices that do not
 include a touch screen.

 By default, the required set of actions is set to <code>ACTIONS_NAVIGATION</code>,
 and the implementation MUST ensure that at least the basic actions (<code>UP</code>,
 <code>DOWN</code>, <code>LEFT</code>, <code>RIGHT</code>, and <code>FIRE</code>) are
 supported.  If the required set of actions is set to <code>ACTIONS_ALL</code>, the implementation
 MUST ensure that all actions (<code>UP</code>, <code>DOWN</code>, <code>LEFT</code>,
 <code>RIGHT</code>, and <code>FIRE</code> <code>GAME_A</code>, <code>GAME_B</code>,
 <code>GAME_C</code>, and <code>GAME_D</code>) are supported.  If the required set of actions
 is set to <code>ACTIONS_NONE</code>, the implementation is not required to support any game
 actions and may hide the on-screen keypad if desired.

 The application may still receive key events for an action even if it is not included in the
 required set.

public int[] <B>getSoftkeyLabelCoordinates</B>(int&nbsp;placement)</PRE>
<DL>
<DD>Gets the upper-left coordinates on the Canvas coordinate system, width, and height of the
 given placement. The returned values represent a rectangular area which the
 implementation uses for drawing a softkey at the given placement.
 These dimensions do not take into account any graphical effects
 (for example, rounded corners, key size that change due to focus change etc). If setCurrent
 has not yet been called to associate this <code>Canvas</code> object with a particular
 <code>Display </code>, this call returns the upper-left coordinates on the primary <code>Display</code>
 coordinate system, width and height for the given placement. In normal mode, this method may return values
 beyond the <code>Canvas</code> width and height or negative values. The method
 only returns coordinates for placements on <code>Display.SOFTKEY_TOP</code>,
 <code>Display.SOFTKEY_BOTTOM</code>, <code>Display.SOFTKEY_LEFT</code> or
 <code>Display.SOFTKEY_RIGHT</code> borders. The method throws
 <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> for placements on the
 <code>Display.SOFTKEY_OFFSCREEN</code> border.
