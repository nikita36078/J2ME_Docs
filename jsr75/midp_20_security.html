		<h1><font face="Arial">Recommended Practices - Implementation of FileConnection APIs 
				within JSR 118 Security Models</font></h1>
		<h2><font face="Arial">Addendum to JSR 75 FileConnection API Specification</font></h2>
		<hr>
		<p><i><b>Copyright © 2002-2004, PalmSource, Inc.&nbsp; All Rights Reserved.</b></i></p>
		<p><i><b>Version 1.0, Proposed Final Draft, 06/30/2003.</b></i></p>
		<hr>
		<h2><font face="Arial">Preface</font></h2>
		<p>JSR 118 (also known as MIDP 2.0) is a profile that contains its own security 
			policy.&nbsp; Its security policy is open ended in the sense that optional 
			packages that are included in an implementation with it are capable of defining 
			how the optional packages' restricted APIs are used within the MIDP security 
			model.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>This addendum is informative. However, all implementations of the JSR 75 
			FileConnection APIs on a MIDP 2.0 implementation are expected to comply with 
			this addendum for a standardized and consistent security framework.</p>
		<h2><font face="Arial">Notation</font></h2>
		<p>The term "file://..." is used as a placeholder to represent any properly formed 
			file URI description.&nbsp; It is not intended to be taken literally as a valid 
			URI.</p>
		<h2><font face="Arial">Untrusted MIDlet Suites</font></h2>
		<p>The MIDP 2.0 security policy defines an <i>untrusted MIDlet suite</i> to be "a 
			MIDlet suite for which the origin and the integrity of the JAR file can NOT be 
			trusted by the device". Furthermore, the MIDP 2.0 security policy requires that 
			"untrusted MIDlet suites MUST execute in the untrusted domain using a 
			restricted environment where access to protected APIs or functions either is 
			not allowed or is allowed with explicit user permission".</p>
		<p>In concordance with this security policy, it is defined that untrusted MIDlet 
			suites that access the protected APIs and functions of the FileConnection APIs 
			MUST be subject to explicit confirmation by the user (this is a similar policy 
			surrounding the use of the <code>http</code> and <code>https</code> protocols). 
			&nbsp; This mandate conforms to requirements defined in both the FileConnection 
			security policy and the MIDP 2.0 security policy.</p>
		<h2><font face="Arial">Trusted MIDlet Suites</font></h2>
		<p>The MIDP 2.0 security policy states that "for APIs defined outside of MIDP 2.0 
			there must be a single document that specifies any necessary permissions and 
			the behavior of the API when it is implemented on MIDP 2.0".&nbsp; This 
			document describes the permissions that are applicable to the FileConnection 
			APIs within the MIDP 2.0 security model.</p>
		<h3><font face="Arial">Permissions</font></h3>
		<p>Permissions are the MIDP 2.0 mechanism by which a MIDlet may request security 
			access to protected APIs or functions.&nbsp; A MIDlet can request access by 
			including the permissions in the <code>MIDlet-Permissions</code> and <code>MIDlet-Permissions-Opt</code>
			attributes in its JAD or manifest.&nbsp; Table 1 defines the permissions 
			applicable to the FileConnection APIs, and the API methods that are protected 
			by those permissions:</p>
		<p align="center"><i>Table 1: FileConnection Permissions and Protected Methods</i></p>
		<table border="1" width="100%">
			<tr>
				<th>
					Permission</th>
				<th>
					Protected API Calls</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td valign="top"><code>javax.microedition.io.Connector.file.read</code></td>
				<td valign="top"><code>javax.microedition.io.Connector </code>methods:<br>
					<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; </code><code>open("file://...")</code><code><br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp; open("file://...", Connector.READ)<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp; open("file://...", Connector.READ_WRITE)<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp; openDataInputStream("file://...")<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp; openInputStream("file://...")</code>
					<p><code>javax.microedition.io.file.FileConnection</code> methods:<br>
						<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; setFileConnection</code>, when instance opened with READ<br>
						<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; setFileConnection</code>, when instance opened with 
						READ_WRITE<br>
					</p>
					<p><code>javax.microedition.io.file.FileSystemRegistry </code>methods:<br>
						<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; addFileSystemListener<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp; listRoots</code></p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td valign="top"><code>javax.microedition.io.Connector.file.write</code></td>
				<td valign="top"><code>javax.microedition.io.Connector </code>methods:<br>
					<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; </code><code>open("file://...")</code><code><br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp; open("file://...", Connector.WRITE)<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp; open("file://...", Connector.READ_WRITE)<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp; openDataOutputStream("file://...")<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp; openOutputStream("file://...")</code>
					<p><code>javax.microedition.io.file.FileConnection</code> methods:<br>
						<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; setFileConnection</code>, when instance opened with WRITE<br>
						<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; setFileConnection</code>, when instance opened with 
						READ_WRITE</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Note that the following protected API calls from the Table 1 require both <code>read</code>
			and <code>write</code> permissions:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><code>Connector.open("file://...")<br>
					Connector.open("file://...", Connector.READ_WRITE)<br>
					FileConnection.setFileConnection("file://...") </code>if the FileConnection 
				instance is opened in READ_WRITE</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h3><font face="Arial">Permission Scope</font></h3>
		<p>It should be noted that the permissions protect API calls, regardless of the 
			data that is being accessed.&nbsp; For example, a successful grant of 
			READ_WRITE access to the&nbsp; <code>Connector.open("file://...") </code>method 
			allows the application to read/write any file or directory, not just the 
			file/directory used as the method's parameter.&nbsp; The parameters of the API 
			calls (which indicate the data being accessed)&nbsp; is not a factor at all in 
			the granting of the permissions, as dictated by MIDP 2.0 security 
			definitions.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, it is recommended that a user 
			interaction mode of "one-shot" be used when user authorization is required so 
			that the user is notified on every instance that a file or directory is 
			accessed.</p>
		<h2><font face="Arial">Implementation Additions</font></h2>
		<p>This recommended practice specifies security based on API access, consistent 
			with the MIDP 2.0 security model.&nbsp; Additionally, if an implementation 
			wishes to have a more granular security model (for example, a model based per 
			file or directory), then the implementation may provide a more granular 
			security model as long as all recommended practices from this document and the 
			MIDP 2.0 security model are also adhered to.&nbsp;</p>
		<h2><font face="Arial">MIDP 2.0 GSM/UMTS Recommended Security Model</font></h2>
		<p>The MIDP 2.0 specification additionally includes a recommended practices 
			document describing the recommended security model for implementing MIDP 2.0 on 
			GSM/UMTS devices.&nbsp; This section describes how the FileConnection APIs can 
			be fit into that recommended security model.&nbsp; Note that this section is 
			for GSM/UMTS devices only, and is not applicable to MIDP 2.0 implementations on 
			devices not supporting those protocols.</p>
		<p>All previously defined recommended practices for the FileConnection APIs in the 
			MIDP 2.0 security model are also applicable in this instance.</p>
		<h3><font face="Arial">Function Groups</font></h3>
		<p>The GSM/UMTS Recommended Security model indicates that permissions should be, 
			but are not required to be, mapped to a defined function group in the 
			recommended model for user convenience.&nbsp;&nbsp; This document recommends 
			that the permissions not be mapped to any of the function groups listed in the 
			GSM/UMTS Recommended Security, but rather leave it to the implementation to 
			choose how the permissions are presented to the user and what the default 
			interaction modes are for the permissions.</p>
