Interface APDUConnection</H2>
<HR>
<DL>
<DT><PRE>public interface <B>APDUConnection</B></DL>
</PRE>

<P>
<p>
 This interface defines the APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit)
 connection. J2ME applications can use this connection
 to communicate with applications on a smart card using APDU protocol.
 ISO 7816-4 defines the APDU protocol as an application-level
 protocol between
 a smart card and an application on the device. There are two types
 of APDU messages:
 command APDUs and response APDUs. Command APDUs are sent to the
 smart card by J2ME applications.
 Response APDUs are the messages received from the smart cards. For
 more information
 on APDU protocol see the ISO 7816-4 specifications.
 </p>
 <p>
 Also J2ME applications can use <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/apdu/APDUConnection.html#getATR()"><CODE>getATR</CODE></A> method in this 
 interface 
 to obtain information regarding an Answer To Reset (ATR) returned 
 by the smart card on card reset and use the 
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/apdu/APDUConnection.html#enterPin(int)"><CODE>enterPin</CODE></A> 
 method to
 ask the user to enter PIN which is sent to the smart card for 
 verification.
 </p>
 <p>
 The methods of APDUConnection are not synchronized. The only method 
 that can be called safely in another thread is close. When close is 
 invoked on a connection that is executing in another thread, any 
 pending I/O method MUST throw an InterruptedIOException. If an 
 application terminates without calling close on the open connection, 
 the implementation SHOULD perform the close operation automatically in 
 order to recover resources, such as the logical channel. 
 </p>
 <h4>
 Creating an APDU Connection
 </h4>
 <p>
 An APDU connection is created by passing a generic connection URI
 string with a card
 application identifier (AID) and optionally the slot in which the
 card is inserted,
 to the <CODE>Connector.open</CODE> method. 
 For example, the
 connection string:</p>
 <pre>
 apdu:0;target=A0.0.0.67.4.7.1F.3.2C.3
 </pre>
 <p>indicates that the connection is to be established with a target
 application having 
 AID A0.0.0.67.4.7.1F.3.2C.3, which resides in
 the smart card
 inserted in the default slot; that is, slot number 0. If the slot number
 is not specified, then the
 default slot is assumed.
 </p>

 <p>
 Each APDU connection has a logical channel reserved exclusively
 for it. That is, the channel
 is dedicated to the J2ME application and the selected smart card
 application until the
 connection is closed. 
 A smart card supporting logical channels allows the host device 
 to open multiple logical channels to communicate with on-card applications.
 Logical channels other than the basic channel may be closed when 
 the connection is closed. Basic channel or channel 0 has to remain
 open while the card is powered on.
 <p>
 Since the basic channel or channel 0 cannot be closed, the 
 terminal should maintain its availability status. 
 When a J2ME application asks for a new connection, the implementation 
 would find out if channel 0 is in use by any application 
 (native or J2ME application). If channel 0 is not in use, the 
 implementation would acquire the channel 0 for communicating with the 
 card application by setting the state of channel 0 to "IN USE". It would 
 then select the desired application on channel 0. If the selection is 
 successful, the newly created connection object would be returned to the 
 J2ME application which can then use it to communicate with the card 
 application.
 If the card application selection fails or the J2ME application calls 
 <code>close</code> on the connection object, the availability state of 
 the basic channel will be set back to "AVAILABLE" meaning that the basic 
 channel is available for use. 
 </p>
 <p>
 When a J2ME application requests a connection to the card and channel 0 
 is in use by some other application (native or J2ME application), the 
 implementation sends a <code>MANAGE CHANNEL</code> command to the 
 card requesting  a logical channel for the 
 new connection. If there is a logical channel available, the card  
 returns with the logical channel number which will be used by the new 
 connection. The implementation would select the desired application on 
 the newly allocated logical channel. If the selection is successful, 
 the implementation returns the newly created connection object to 
 the J2ME application which can then use it for communicating with the card 
 application. If application selection fails or the J2ME application calls 
 <code>close()</code> method to close the connection with 
 the card application, the implementation will send a 
 <code>MANAGE CHANNEL</code> command to
 the card to close the channel. The channel will then be available for use by 
 other applications.
 </p>
 <p>
 In the case when there are no logical channels available or the
 card does not
 support logical channels, the card will return an error. An 
 <code>IOException</code> will be thrown and no connection object will be 
 returned to the J2ME application. 
 </p>
 <h4>
 Communicating With Smart Card Applications
 </h4>
 <p>
 Once an APDU connection is created, the J2ME application can use the
  <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/apdu/APDUConnection.html#exchangeAPDU(byte[])"><CODE>exchangeAPDU</CODE></A>
 method to send command APDUs and receive response APDUs to and from
 the card. 
 J2ME applications cannot use <code>exchangeAPDU</code>
 to send card
 application selection APDUs or channel management APDUs. Card
 application selection is allowed only by calling <code>Connector.open</code>
 method with the URI
 string described above and logical channels management is defined by 
 API functionality.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 There may be several APDU connections open at the same time using 
 different logical channels with the same card. However, since APDU 
 protocol is synchronous, there can be no interleaving of command and 
 their response APDUs across logical channels. Between the receipt of 
 the command APDU and the sending of the response APDU to that command,
 only one logical channel is active. 
 For T=0 protocol, for case 4 and case 2 command APDUs the card may 
 respond with '61 XX' or '6C XX'.  These special cases MUST be handled by 
 the implementation in the following manner:
 <ul>
 <li>
 '61 XX': The implementation MUST send GET RESPONSE to 
 the card to get the response data before any other command is sent.
 </li>
 <li>
 '6C XX': The implementation MUST resend the command after setting Le equal 
 to XX received from the card before any other command is sent.
 </li>
 </ul>
 In both the cases discussed above, the implementation MUST make sure that 
 between sending the command APDU, receiving status word '61 XX' or 
 '6C XX', and sending GET RESPONSE or resending the command APDU with Le 
 set to XX respectively, there MUST not be any other APDU exchange on any 
 logical channel with the card. In case the status word '61 XX' is 
 received multiple times successively from the card, the implementation 
 must accumulate
 all the response data received from the card before returning it to the
 J2ME application. J2ME applications MUST remain oblivious of 
 the exchanges mentioned above and should only get the response received 
 as a result of the above operations.
 </p>
 <h4>
 Communicating With Multiple Smart Card Applications
 </h4>
 <p>
 A J2ME application may connect and communicate with multiple smart card
 applications interchangeably or have multiple connections with the
 same card application, if the card application is multi-selectable. To
 achieve this the
 J2ME application can repeat the procedure mentioned above to create
 corresponding connection objects.
 </p>
 <h4>
 Closing an APDUConnection
 </h4>
 <p>
 J2ME application can call 
 <code>javax.microedition.io.Connection.close()</code> on an APDU 
 connection to close the
 connection. If the connection was established on channel other than
 channel 0, this action closes the channel consequently deselecting
 the card application and making the channel available for use 
 by other applications. In case of channel 0, the channel is marked
 as available for use by other applications. The application selected
 on channel 0 is not deselected at the time the connection is closed
 but remains selected until a new connection is established on
 channel 0. 
 </p>
 <h3>Exceptions that can be Thrown During Connection Establishment</h3>
 A <code>ConnectionNotFoundException</code> is thrown in any of the following
 situations:
 <p>
 <ul>
    <li>if the card slot does not exist</li>
    <li>if the card is not inserted or powered on</li>
    <li>if the card application selection fails because
        the card application with the specified application
        identifier does not exist or because the card application
        refused selection</li>
 </ul>
 </p>
 <p>If the card application selection fails because the J2ME application
 is not allowed to access the application with the specified application
 identifier a <code>SecurityException</code> is thrown.</p>

 <p>In cases such as when there is no logical channel available to
 establish a connection, an <code>IOException</code>
 will be thrown and a connection object will not be returned to the 
 J2ME application.</p>
 <p>
 If a card is removed after the connection is established and then 
 re-inserted,
 the J2ME application will have to re-establish the connection and get a new
 connection object. Any attempts to exchange APDUs using the connection
 object created before removal of the card will result in 
 <code>InterruptedIOException</code> being thrown.
 </p>

 <h3>
 BNF Format for Connector.open() string
 </h3>
 <p>

 The URI MUST conform to the BNF syntax specified below.  If the URI
 does not conform to this syntax, an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>
 is thrown.
 </p>
 <table BORDER="1">

 <td>&lt;<em>APDU_connection_string</em>&gt; </td>

 </tr>
 
 </table>
 <h3>Smart Card Slot Discovery Mechanism</h3>
 <p> J2ME devices may support a variable number of security elements
 (usually smart card slots). Some security elements are permanently
 attached to the device (e.g. a soldered chip), others are removable.
 The removable security elements may be cold-swappable, requiring
 the battery to be removed before the security element can be exchanged
 (e.g. a MiniSIM slot hidden behind the battery). Other removable
 security elements can be inserted and removed while the system is
 running. (e.g. a hot-swappable smart card reader).    </p>
 <p>
 A system property is defined to indicate the names of the 
 smart card slots. The property can be queried through the 
 <code>System.getProperty()</code> method using the key 
 <em>microedition.smartcardslots</em>. The value returned 
 is a comma-separated list of the smart card slots which can
 be used in the <code>Connector.open()</code> string to identify the 
 specific smart card slot.
 </p>
 <p> 
 If the platform includes a (U)SIM card, it MUST be in slot 0.    
 </p>
 <p> 
 The logical slot names include the slot number and a descriptor 
 indicating the type of the slot. For cold-swappable slots the 
 letter 'C' is appended to the slot number. For hot-swappable slots
 the letter 'H' is appended to the slot number. The slot descriptors (the
 letter 'C' and 'H' appended to the slot number) cannot be passed as part
 of the URI to open a connection to the smart card application. The J2ME
 application MUST remove the descriptor from the logical slot name and
 only use the slot number in URI to identify the specific smart card
 slot. 
 </p>
 <p> A typical configuration for a cold-swappable SIM card and 
 a hot-swappable removable card would be: </p>
 <pre><code> <br> microedition.smartcardslots: 0C,1H<br></code></pre>
 
 <h3>
 Support for (U)SIM Application Toolkit
 </h3>
 <p>
 If an implementation allows J2ME applications to communicate with (U)SAT, 
 support for communication with (U)SAT should be implemented as specified 
 below.</p>
 <p>
 The APDUConnection can be used to communicate with (U)SAT applications on
 channel 0.
 The following sections describe the constraints and methods 
 in supporting communicating with (U)SAT applications.
 </p>
 <h4>
 Technical Constraints
 </h4>
 <ul>
 <li>The operator domain has full and exclusive access to this connection.
 </li>
 <li>Only ENVELOPE APDUs may be sent. For all other APDUs  
 <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> is thrown.</li>
 <li>The class byte MUST be set by the implementation which will be either
 A0 or 80 depending on whether the phone is running GSM or UMTS. The class
 byte supplied by the J2ME application will be ignored.</li>
 <li>In the case when (U)SIM responds with status word '9E XX' or '9F XX',
 the behavior of APDUConnection would be the same as when
 status word '61 XX' is received from the card.</li>
 <li>In the case when (U)SIM responds with status word '62 XX' or '63 XX' 
 the implementation MUST send GET RESPONSE to the card with Le set to '00' 
 before any other command is sent. The implementation MUST make 
 sure that between sending the ENVELOPE APDU, receiving status word '62 XX'
 or '63 XX', and sending GET RESPONSE APDU with Le set to '00', there MUST 
 not be any other APDU exchange on any logical channel with the card.</li>
 <li> When the J2ME application sends an ENVELOPE APDU to the (U)SIM, the 
 native application may be performing a proactive session. In this case the 
 (U)SIM MUST manage the synchronization issue. The (U)SIM may respond
 with status word '93 00' (SIM Application Toolkit is busy) when the
 (U)SIM is performing another proactive session.</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
 Open Connection with (U)SIM, invoke, Close Connection 
 </h4>
 To communicate using (U)SAT commands, a J2ME application performs these 
 steps:
 <ul>
 <li>The J2ME application establishes a connection by using the 
 <code>Connector.open</code> method. To open a connection with a 
 smart card using (U)SAT commands, the URI string passed to the 
 <code>Connector.open</code> method MUST be the following:<br>
 <br>
 "apdu:&lt;slot&gt;;target=SAT"<br>
 <br>
 Where "apdu" is the protocol and slot is the card slot having
 the (U)SIM. The value "SAT" for parameter "target" indicates
 that the connection is to be established with (U)SAT.<br>
 <br>
 The implementation MUST use logical channel 0 even if this channel is 
 occupied by other applications, and MUST not send a 
 <code>MANAGE CHANNEL</code> or a <code>SELECT</code> by DF NAME command
 to the (U)SIM.</li>
 <li>The J2ME application invokes the <code>exchangeAPDU</code> method on 
 <code>javax.microedition.apdu.APDUConnection</code> interface to send the 
 ENVELOPE commands. The J2ME application MUST not initiate a proactive 
 session since if a proactive session is started, it could cause
 synchronization problems with other entities talking to the (U)SAT, such as
 other J2ME applications or native applications.
 If a proactive session is started by the (U)SAT application in 
 response to an envelope sent by the J2ME application, it is the 
 responsibility of the J2ME application to deal with it accordingly.<br>
 The implementation MUST check the INS byte of the APDU 
 sent by the J2ME application. If the APDU is not an ENVELOPE
 command, the implementation throws an 
 <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>. The
 implementation MUST set the CLA byte corresponding to whether the phone 
 is running GSM or UMTS.</li>
 <li>To close the connection, the J2ME application invokes the close method
 on javax.microedition.apdu.APDUConnection. The implementation MUST not send
 a CLOSE CHANNEL to the (U)SIM.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>
 APDUConnection Example
 </h3>

 <p>
 The following example shows how an <code>APDUConnection</code>
 can be used to access a smart card application.
 </p>
 <pre>
 APDUConnection acn = null;
 try{
     // Create an APDUConnection object
     acn = (APDUConnection)
           Connector.open("apdu:0;target=A0.0.0.67.4.7.1F.3.2C.3");
 
     // Send a command APDU and receive response APDU
     responseAPDU = acn.exchangeAPDU(commandAPDU);
      ...
 } catch (IOException e) {
   ...
 } finally {
   ...
   if(acn != null) {
      // Close connection
      acn.close();
   }
   ...
 }
 ...
</pre>
 <h3>
 Note regarding PIN-related methods
 </h3>
 <p>
 A platform should implement the PIN entry UI in such a way that:
 <ul>
 <li>
 the UI is distinguishable from a UI generated by external sources 
 (for example J2ME applications)
 </li>
 <li>
 external sources are not able to retrieve or insert PIN data
 </li>
 <li>
 If the static access control mechanism is implemented, the PIN 
 related methods MUST be implemented as specified in the static access
 control mechanism. For further details see Appendix A (Recommended 
 Security Element Access Control).
 </li>
 </ul>

 in the CLA byte of the command APDU. 
 
 Communication with a smart card device is synchronous.
 This method blocks until the response has been received
 from the smart card application, or is interrupted.
 The interruption could be due to the card being removed from
 the slot or operation timeout.
