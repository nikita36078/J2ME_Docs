			Java 2™ Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME™).</p>
		<h2>Preface</h2>
		<p>This document defines a set of APIs known as the <i>Personal Information Management 
				(PIM) APIs</i> for Java<sup>™</sup> 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME<sup>™</sup>). 
			These APIs are included in J2ME profiles as an <i>optional package</i>.&nbsp; 
			Optional packages are API sets that may be licensed and added on top of J2ME 
			configuration and profile implementations by vendors independent of the JSR 
			process.&nbsp; This allows VM implementations to increase the functionality 
			they offer while still providing APIs that are defined as a standard by the 
			Java community.</p>
		<p>The PIM APIs were developed by as part of JSR 75.&nbsp; There is no dependency 
			of these PIM APIs upon any other APIs produced in JSR 75, and the PIM APIs can 
			be licensed and packaged separately from any other J2ME configuration, profile, 
			or optional package.&nbsp;</p>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>The primary goal of the PIM APIs is to provide access to <i>Personal Information 
				Management</i> (PIM) data on J2ME devices. PIM data is defined as 
			information included in address book, calendar application, and to do list 
			applications. In addition, implementations can provide access to PIM databases 
			that are not resident on the device but at well known locations, located on SIM 
			cards attached to the device, or to PIM databases created and managed by the 
			Java VM itself. This allows implementations of the PIM API to provide PIM 
			databases on devices that previously did not have them, as well as providing 
			access to remote PIM databases from a J2ME device.
		</p>
		<h2>Applicable Platform</h2>
		<p>CLDC 1.0 is the minimum required platform for this API set. The APIs in this 
			package only depends on APIs required by the CLDC 1.0 API set. That allows the 
			PIM APIs to be deployed as an optional API package on any J2ME profile that 
			supports CLDC 1.0 or higher.</p>
		<h2>Specification Requirements</h2>
		<p>This section lists explicit requirements of this specification. Implementations 
			of the PIM API must follow these requirements. Profiles including this PIM API 
			package may require additional requirements above and beyond the ones listed 
			here.</p>
		<p>Compliant PIM API implementations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			MUST include all packages, classes, and interfaces described in this 
			specification.
			<li>
			MUST provide support for at least one of the types of PIM lists defined in this 
			API: either ContactList, EventList, or ToDoList.
			<li>
			MUST provide access to one or more actual PIM lists for each supported PIM list 
			type.
			<li>
			MAY provide support for all types of PIM lists defined in this API: 
			ContactList, EventList, and ToDoList.
			<li>
			MUST provide a security model for accessing the PIM APIs.
			<li>
				MUST support at least <a href="http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcard-21.txt">vCard 2.1</a>
				and <a href="http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcal-10.txt">vCalendar 1.0</a> data formats 
				for importing and exporting items via serial formats mechanism defined in 
				javax.microedition.pim.PIM class. Implementations MUST support <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1521.txt">
					Quoted-Printable</a> and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1521.txt">BASE64</a>
			encoding formats in import and export.
			<li>
				MUST support at least the <a href="http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2279.txt">UTF-8</a>
			character encoding for APIs that allow the application to define character 
			encodings.
			<li>
				MAY support other character encodings.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>API Goals</h2>
		<p>The goals for the PIM APIs are as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Provide <b>access</b> to entries in an <b>address book</b>
			that may or may not reside on the device.
			<li>
				Provide <b>access</b> to entries in a <b>calendar</b>
			that may or may not reside on the device.
			<li>
				Provide <b>access</b> to entries in a <b>to do list</b>
			that may or may not reside on the device.
			<li>
				Provide an API that allows access to all fields in <strong>native PIM databases</strong>.
			<li>
				Provide <b>security</b>
			in using these APIs so that unauthorized Java applications may not access the 
			entries contained in the PIM lists.
			<li>
				Support <b>categories</b>
			of entries in the PIM lists.&nbsp; Specifically, zero or more categories per 
			record are to be supported as dictated by the device’s PIM implementation.
			<li>
				Provide an PIM API such that implementations of it can be made in a <b>memory and 
					performance efficient</b>
			manner, targeted specifically for the J2ME CLDC space.&nbsp;
			<li>
				Support the <b>import and export</b> of address book entries in a <b>vCard </b>format 
				specified by the Internet Mail Consortium (see <a href="http://www.imc.org/pdi/">http://www.imc.org/pdi</a>).&nbsp;
			<li>
				Support the <b>import and export</b> of calendar and to do entries in a <b>vCalendar</b>
				format specified by the Internet Mail Consortium (see <a href="http://www.imc.org/pdi/">
					http://www.imc.org/pdi</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Given these goals, a new API was devised to access PIM data in the most 
			efficient manner possible.&nbsp; The API resides in a new J2ME package, <code><em>javax.microedition.pim</em></code>. 
			Detailed description of&nbsp; the PIM API scan be found in the <a href="../PIM/javadoc/javax/microedition/pim/package-summary.html">
				JavaDoc API Specification</a>.</p>
		<h2>Package Discovery</h2>
		<p>Because of its optional nature, this package of APIs may not always be available 
			on every platform. Each profile and platform may have their own methods for 
			J2ME package discovery as there is no universal method existing at this 
			time.&nbsp; An additional method for package discovery of the PIM APIs is by 
			using a system properties query. To discover this package, call <font face="Times New Roman">
				<code>System.getProperty</code></font> with a key of <font face="Times New Roman">
				<code>microedition.pim.version</code></font>. If the API is present, the 
			value returned is the version of the API (e.g. "1.0"). If the API is not 
			present then the key is also not present and <font face="Times New Roman"><code>null</code></font>
			is returned.</p>
		<h2>PIM List Support</h2>
		<p>There are three types of PIM lists accessible through this API: ToDoList, 
			EventList, and ContactList. PIM implementations MUST support at least one type 
			of PIM list (either ToDoList, EventList, or ContactList). For example, an 
			implementation may choose to support only ContactList PIM access should the 
			ToDoList and EventList databases not exist or are not applicable on the 
			implementation's platform. If a type of PIM list is not supported, then the 
			methods used to access the unsupported PIM list (i.e. <code>PIM.openPIMList(int, 
				int) and PIM.openPIMList(int, int, String)</code><font face="Times New Roman"><code>)</code></font>
			MUST return a <code>PIMException</code> when invoked with the correspoding PIM 
			list type. PIM implementations SHOULD support all three types of PIM lists to 
			enhance the compatibility of the implementation with all PIM API applications.</p>
		<p>For each PIM list type that an implementation supports, at least one PIM list 
			MUST be supported (e.g. at least one list must be able to be opened). 
			Implementations MAY support any number of PIM lists of each PIM list type that 
			it supports. For example, an implementation may have 1 ToDoList, 2 EventList, 
			and 0 ContactList. Each PIM list must have a name assigned to it that is unique 
			among all PIM lists of that same type on the platform. The name of each PIM 
			list is used to open the list using <code>PIM.openPIMList(int, int String)</code>.
		</p>
		<p>Additionally, if one or more lists exist for a particular PIM list type, one of 
			those lists MUST be designated by the implementation as the <em>default list</em>
			for that PIM type. The designation is used in two locations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The default list for a PIM list type MUST be accessed through the open list 
				method with no parameters (i.e. <code>PIM.openPIMList(int, int)</code>).
			<li>
				The first element in the String array returned by the PIMList list method (i.e. <code>
					PIM.listPIMLists()</code>) MUST be the unique name of the designated 
				default list for that PIM list type.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Native Database Support</h2>
		<p>If a PIM API list is mapped to an underlying native PIM database, the PIM API 
			list SHOULD be the default list for that given PIM list type. If more than one 
			underlying native PIM database for a given PIM type (e.g. ContactList, 
			EventList, or ToDoList) is also mapped to another PIM API list, only one of 
			those PIM lists SHOULD be designated as the default.</p>
		<p>Implementations are not required to persist all fields originally contained in 
			an PIM item imported into a list describing a native PIM database. 
			Implementations MAY choose to persist only the fields that are supported in the 
			underlying native PIM database.&nbsp; Handling of those fields that are not 
			supported in the underlying PIM databases is left up to the 
			implementation.&nbsp; For instance, assume a platform's native address database 
			only supports one address per entry.&nbsp; Then assume an address item is 
			created from a vCard data string containing two addresses. If that item is 
			imported to the native address database through a corresponding PIM list, the 
			PIM list implementation could ignore and discard the second address, it could 
			map the address to an available custom field in the database, or it could 
			append the address as a note to the entry.</p>
		<h2>vCard and vCalendar Support</h2>
		<p>The PIM API provides support for importing and exporting its PIM data in vCard 
			and vCalendar formats. This support is provided so that the PIM API can 
			communicate with external PIM databases via a well-known industry standard. 
			This PIM API is not meant to be a Java version of the vCard and vCalendar 
			standards; the PIM API's main goal is providing access to a device's native PIM 
			data. vCard and vCalendar are only adopted for its applicability to 
			communicating with other PIM databases in a standard way.</p>
		<p>The PIM API does not explicitly support all fields described in the vCard and 
			vCalendar data formats.&nbsp; Support for vCard and vCalendar in the PIM APIs 
			is defined such that all of the data accessible in a native PIM database 
			through the PIM API can in turn be expressed as vCard or vCalendar data when 
			importing or exporting.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The PIM API PIM fields that are not also vCard or vCalendar defined fields are 
			mapped to extended fields in those formats (i.e. prefixed with "X-") when 
			exporting. vCard or vCalendar fields that are present in the underlying PIM 
			databases but not expressed as explicit fields in the APIs are accessed as 
			extended fields and mapped correctly by the implementation to their 
			corresponding vCard or vCalendar type field.</p>
		<p><b>vCard 2.1</b> is the default vCard version supported in the PIM API and MUST 
			be supported if&nbsp; the implementation supports contact lists.&nbsp; UTF-8 
			MUST be supported on the platform as a character encoding method for vCard 2.1 
			entries ("charset" in vCard 2.1 terminology).&nbsp; Additionally, the 
			Quoted-Printable and Base64 encodings for binary content as defined by RFC 1521 
			must be supported by an implementation.&nbsp; Implementations MAY also support 
			other character encoding methods in addition to UTF-8.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Implementations MAY also support other versions of the vCard 
			specification.&nbsp; If other versions are supported, both importing and 
			exporting in that vCard format must be supported (i.e. import only or export 
			only is not allowed; it must be both).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b>vCalendar 1.0</b> is the default vCalendar version supported in the PIM API 
			and MUST be supported if the implementation supports event lists or to do 
			lists.&nbsp; UTF-8 MUST be supported on the platform as a character encoding 
			method for vCalendar 1.0 entries ("charset" in vCalendar 1.0 
			terminology).&nbsp; Additionally, Quoted-Printable and Base64 encoding for 
			binary content as defined by RFC 1521 must be supported by an 
			implementation.&nbsp; Implementations MAY also support other character encoding 
			methods in addition to UTF-8.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Implementations MAY support other versions of the vCalendar specification.&nbsp; 
			If other versions are supported, both importing and exporting in that vCard 
			format must be supported (i.e. import only or export only is not allowed; it 
			must be both).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>Access Synchronization</h2>
		<p>No locking operations are provided in this API. PIM implementations ensure that 
			all individual PIM list record operations are atomic, synchronous, and 
			serialized so that no corruption occurs with multiple accesses. However, if an 
			application uses multiple threads to access a PIM list, it is the application's 
			responsibility to coordinate this access, or unintended consequences may 
			result. For example, if two threads in an application both call <code>Contact.commit()</code>
			concurrently on the same contact item, the PIM list serializes these calls 
			properly, and no database corruption occurs as a result. However, the latter of 
			the writes is subsequently overwritten by the other, which may cause problems 
			within the application.
		</p>
		<p>Synchronization issues may also exist if a platform allows access to the native 
			underlying database outside of the Java realm (e.g. through native platform 
			synchronization or through native PIM applications). In these cases it is the 
			platform's responsibility to enforce exclusive access to the PIM data between 
			the J2ME application and native applications to ensure proper serialization and 
			updating of the data.</p>
		<p>However, the PIM API is not required to handle multitasking environments and 
			concurrent access to PIM data. For example, in multitasking environments 
			categories in a particular Contact list may be modified by a native application 
			concurrently when a Java application is accessing the same Contact list. In 
			these scenarios, there is no guarantee that the Java PIM lists accurately 
			reflect real-time changes to the underlying PIM databases. The result in these 
			cases are implementation dependent (e.g. some may not reflect the changed 
			categories until the categories are specifically read using 
			PIMList.getCategories, while others may accurately update the Java PIM list's 
			category list). In general, this PIM API is targeting constrained devices that 
			usually allow one application to be running at a single instance on the 
			platform. In these cases, the synchronization issues are non-existent.</p>
		<h2>Security</h2>
		<p>It is the responsibility of the J2ME platform that the PIM APIs are deployed on 
			to provide a security model supporting the security of the PIM APIs. 
			Specifically:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			The security model MUST support access rights for read only, write only, and 
			read write.
			<li>
				The security model MUST be applied in those methods in the <code>javax.microedition.pim</code>
				package that throw <code>SecurityExceptions</code>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The implementation of the model is left up to the including profile or platform.
		</p>
		<p>If the including profile is MIDP 2.0 (as defined by JSR 118), then included with 
			this specification is an addendum outlining a Recommended Practice for using 
			the FileConnection APIs within the MIDP 2.0 security model.&nbsp; That addendum 
			can be found <a href="midp_20_security.html">here</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
		<p>This section discusses concepts that are fundamental issues for the implementers 
			of the PIM API package.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Extended Field Handling</strong>: Implementations are required to 
				generate and interpret valid vCard and vCalendar entries in the import and 
				export methods of PIMList (i.e. <font face="Times New Roman"><code>PIM.toSerialFormat()</code></font>
				and <font face="Times New Roman"><code>PIM.fromSerialFormat()</code></font>). 
				The standard fields for a PIM item already have mappings defined in the API to 
				their corresponding vCard and vCalendar tags. It is the responsibility of the 
				PIM API implementation to map any extended fields supported in the PIM lists to 
				valid vCard and vCalendar tags, according to the syntax defined for those API 
				definitions. Implementations SHOULD map extended fields to corresponding actual 
				field tags not explicitly supported in the PIM API if possible (e.g. a sound 
				extended field should map to vCard property SOUND). If an implementation maps 
				extended fields to actual field tags, the implementation is responsible to 
				ensure that the item produces a valid vCard or vCalendar entry when exported or 
				imported. If not mapped to explicit vCard or vCalendar tags, implementations 
				SHOULD map extended fields to the extended field syntax defined in those APIs 
				(i.e. prefixed with "X-").</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Extended Field and Attribute Constant Values</strong>: All extended 
				fields or extended attributes provided by an implementation MUST have a 
				constant value greater than or equal to <code>PIMItem.EXTENDED_FIELD_MIN_VALUE</code>
				and <code>PIMItem.EXTENDED_ATTRIBUTE_MIN_VALUE</code>, respectively.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Category Names</strong>: The PIM API specifies that category names are 
				handled in a case sensitive manner. However, this does not require that the 
				underlying native PIM database also provide case sensitive category names. If 
				the underlying PIM database is case insensitive, the implementation may map 
				categories names to their case insensitive equivalents on persistence of the 
				items. For example, should two items be assigned to categories "WORK" and 
				"work" respectively and then persisted, both may be persisted to the same 
				underlying category of "work" in the native database. Subsequent retrieval of 
				those items and querying their categories would reveal the identical categories 
				of "work" and "work" respectively.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Field Mappings for Known Serial Formats</strong>: The fields contained 
				in the PIM items are mapped to corresponding fields in vCard or vCalendar 
				specifications. If an implementation supports a particular vCard or vCalendar 
				specification and supports any of these PIM standard fields in one or more of 
				its PIM lists, then the implementation MUST use these mappings. The following 
				tables identify those mappings. Additionally, categories for all PIM items 
				(i.e. Contacts, Events, and ToDos) are mapped to the vCalendar and vCard 
				CATEGORIES property name.</li>

				<strong>Serial Data Format Specification:</strong> The strings used for the 
				support serial data formats returned from <code>PIM.contactSerialFormats()</code>,
				<code>PIM.eventSerialFormats()</code>, and <code>PIM.toDoSerialFormats()</code> 
				must follow a consistent naming convention. The naming convention is the common 
				name of the data format in all capital letters, followed by a slash ("/") 
				followed by the version number of the data format. For example, "VCARD/2.1", 
				"VCARD/3.0" and "VCALENDAR/1.0". The formats required by this spec and/or any 
				formats required by an including profile must be returned first in the string 
				arrays returned from the aforementioned methods (i.e. "VCARD/2.1" must be the 
				first item in the array returned from <code>PIM.contactSerialFormats()</code> and 
				"VCALENDAR/1.0" must be the first item in the arrays returned from <code>PIM.eventSerialFormats()</code>
				and <code>PIM.toDoSerialFormats()</code>. The following table outlines the 
				naming convention for some current well known PIM protocols.</li>

				<strong>Ordering of Fields Lists</strong>: It is recommended (but not required) 
				that implementations return the fields from the method <code>PIMList.getSupportedFields()</code>
				in an order similar, if not identical, to the display ordering of those same 
				fields in any corresponding native PIM application. This allows Java 
				applications using the PIM APIs to maintain a semblance of platform continuity 
				in their application (i.e. trying to maintain look and feel of the platform's 
				applications).</li>
