<P>
<p>A scene graph node that represents a 2-dimensional image with a 3D
position.</p>

<p>Sprite3D is a fast, but functionally restricted alternative to
textured geometry. A Sprite3D is rendered as a screen-aligned
rectangular array of pixels with a constant depth. The apparent size
of a sprite may be specified directly in pixels (an unscaled sprite)
or indirectly using the transformation from the Sprite3D node to the
camera space (a scaled sprite).</p>

<p>The structure of a Sprite3D object is shown in the figure below.</p>

<center><img src="./doc-files/Sprite3D-components.png"
width="357" height="126"/></center>

<h3>Sprite image data</h3>

<p>The sprite image is stored as a reference to an Image2D. The image
may be in any of the formats defined in Image2D. The width and height
of the image are not limited in any way; in particular, they need not
be powers of two. However, there is an implementation defined maximum
size for the crop rectangle (the area of the sprite that is actually
displayed). This can be queried with <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/m3g/Graphics3D.html#getProperties()"><CODE>getProperties</CODE></A>.</p>

<p>The displayed sprite image can be mirrored with respect to the X
and/or Y axes by specifying a crop rectangle with a negative width
and/or height, respectively.</p>

<p>If the referenced Image2D is mutable and is modified while it is
bound to a Sprite3D, or a new Image2D is bound as the sprite image, the
modifications are immediately reflected in the Sprite3D. Be aware,
however, that changing or updating the sprite image may trigger
time-consuming operations.</p>

<h3>Sprite positioning and scaling</h3>

<p>The position of a sprite on screen is determined by projecting the
origin of its coordinate system to screen coordinates. The resulting
2D position is used as the center of the displayed pixel array. If
this causes any part of the sprite to be placed off screen, then the
sprite is clipped to the visible portion of the viewport as usual
(refer to Graphics3D).</p>

<p>The depth value of a sprite is constant across the image, and is the
depth of the origin of the Sprite3D coordinate system.</p>

<p>The width and height of an <i>unscaled</i> sprite on screen are measured
in pixels, and they are equal to the (absolute) width and height of the crop
rectangle. Recall that the crop rectangle dimensions may be negative to flip
the pixels; this has no effect on the size of the sprite.</p>

<p>The width and height of a <i>scaled</i> sprite on screen are computed
basically as if the sprite were a rectangle with unit-length sides, lying
on the XY plane of its local coordinate system and centered at its origin.
<span class="new">The contents of the crop rectangle are scaled to fill
the projected unit rectangle.</span>
See the Implementation guidelines below for the details.</p>

<p>Because a sprite is always displayed as a screen-aligned rectangle,
the effects of other than rigid-body transformations on sprites may
not be immediately intuitive, even though they are well-defined. It is
advised that, for example, non-uniform scaling and skewing be avoided
in sprite modelview matrices. Similarly, oblique projections should be
used with caution when sprites are present in the displayed scene.</p>

<h3>Sprite rendering attributes</h3>

<p>The rendering attributes for a Sprite3D are determined by its
Appearance, as is the case with Mesh objects. There are a number of
properties in Appearance, however, that do not have a meaningful
interpretation in this context. Thus, only the CompositingMode and Fog
components and the layer index are taken into account when rendering a
sprite. The rest of the components are ignored. This implies, in
particular, that lighting does not apply for sprites.</p>

<h3>Sprite picking</h3>

<p>Only scaled sprites can be picked. This is because the dimensions of
an unscaled sprite are only defined in screen space, that is, after the
viewport transformation. Since the viewport parameters are not available
to the pick method, the dimensions of an unscaled sprite can not be
computed.</p>

<p>Picking of scaled sprites is analogous to how they are rendered.
Picking is done in normalized device coordinates (after projection,
before viewport transformation), where the position, depth value and
dimensions of scaled sprites are well defined. See the Implementation
guidelines for how to calculate these.</p>

<p>Since the sprite size calculation requires a Camera, sprites are
only pickable through the viewing plane, not from an arbitrary
position in the scene. That is, of the two <code>pick</code> variants
in Group, only the one that takes in a Camera as a parameter can be
used in sprite picking. The other variant simply ignores all sprite
nodes.</p>

<p>If a sprite is intersected by the pick ray, the pixel in the sprite
image at the intersection point will be further tested for transparency.
If the pixel is fully transparent, the sprite is not picked and the pick
ray will continue towards objects that are further away. If the pixel is
not fully transparent, the sprite is picked. A pixel is defined to be
fully transparent if and only if it fails the alpha test (see <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/m3g/CompositingMode.html#setAlphaThreshold(float)"><CODE>CompositingMode.setAlphaThreshold</CODE></A>)
<span class="new">prior to applying the alpha factor</span>.</p>

<h3>Implementation guidelines</h3>

<p>Sprites do not provide any functionality that would not be available
otherwise; they can always be substituted with textured meshes. However,
the existence of the sprite primitive acts as a signal to the renderer
that a very specific subset of functionality is required. This allows the
rendering pipeline to avoid the overhead of transforming and lighting full
geometry. It also allows the rasterizer to select an optimized drawing
routine to place the pixels on the screen, without the potentially complex
interpolation of parameters across the rectangle. This can be used to make
sprites very much faster than textured meshes (especially in software)
which in turn increases the richness of content that can be offered at
the low end.</p>

<p class="new">Filtering of scaled sprites can be implemented with the simple
nearest neighbor algorithm, but implementations are recommended to apply
a more sophisticated scheme, such as bilinear filtering with mipmapping.
No application control over the filtering behavior is provided, however;
if that is required, the application should use textured rectangles
instead. For unscaled sprites, the implementation should ensure that
rounding errors or similar do not yield unwelcome artifacts, such as
pixel columns appearing and disappearing depending on the screen
position of the sprite. This is particularly important for text labels.</p>

<h4>Implementing with textures</h4>

<p class="new">Sprite3D can be implemented with textured rectangles.
To facilitate that, implementations are allowed to upscale or downscale the
sprite image to power-of-two dimensions, preferably using bilinear filtering
or better. Images exceeding the maximum texture size may be downscaled to
the maximum size. However, implementations striving for best image quality
would keep the large original image around, texturing the rectangle with
the crop rectangle contents only.
Note that if the sprite image is mutable, the original image must be kept
around in any case.</p>

<p class="new">The sprite alpha factor can be trivially implemented with
the <code>MODULATE</code> texture blending mode, by setting the fragment
alpha equal to the effective alpha factor and the fragment color components
to 1.0. Another option is to premultiply the alpha factor into the alpha
channel of the sprite image; however, the implementation must then make
sure that the original alpha values can always be recovered intact.</p>

<h4>Computing the position and size</h4>

<p>The position of a sprite on the viewport is simply the projected
location of the Sprite3D node's origin. Similarly, the depth of the
sprite is the projected depth of the origin.</p>

<p>The size of a sprite, in pixels, depends on whether the sprite is
scaled or not. An unscaled sprite is the same size as its crop
rectangle. Calculating the size of a scaled sprite is slightly more
complicated. In principle, it only involves projecting the Sprite3D
node's X and Y axes into screen space and computing their length,
but to make the calculation well defined under arbitrary transformations,
a few additional steps are required. The exact formula is given below.</p>

<p>Let us define <b>M</b> and <b>P</b> as the current modelview and
projection matrices. The modelview matrix <b>M</b> is the concatenated
transformation from the Sprite3D node into camera space (taking into
account all of the transformation components of the Sprite3D, including
the user-settable static matrix), and <b>P</b> is the projection
matrix of the current camera.</p>

<p>Let us first transform the origin and two reference points,
corresponding to the X and Y axes, from the Sprite3D node's
coordinate system into camera space:</p>

<ul>
<b>o</b>' = <b>M</b> (0, 0, 0, 1)<sup>T</sup><br>
<b>x</b>' = <b>M</b> (1, 0, 0, 1)<sup>T</sup><br>
<b>y</b>' = <b>M</b> (0, 1, 0, 1)<sup>T</sup>
</ul>

<p>We then compute the distances from the origin to the X and Y
reference points. If the bottom row of the modelview matrix is
not (0 0 0 1), the transformed points may have W values different
from each other. The points are thus brought into an equal scale
(W = 1) before computing the distance.</p>

<ul>
dx = | <b>x</b>'/x'<sub>w</sub> - <b>o</b>'/o'<sub>w</sub> |<br>
dy = | <b>y</b>'/y'<sub>w</sub> - <b>o</b>'/o'<sub>w</sub> |
</ul>

<p>Note that the W components of the homogeneous points cancel
out in the subtraction, and the lengths computed are those of
the 3D vectors. We then define (new) X and Y reference points
that lie on the X and Y axes of the camera and whose distances
from the origin are dx and dy, respectively. Applying the
projection matrix, we transform the origin and the reference
points into clip space:</p>

<ul>
<b>o</b>'' = <b>P</b> <b>o</b>'<br>
<b>x</b>'' = <b>P</b> [<b>o</b>' + (dx, 0, 0, 0)<sup>T</sup>]<br>
<b>y</b>'' = <b>P</b> [<b>o</b>' + (0, dy, 0, 0)<sup>T</sup>]
</ul>

<p>Again, we compute the distances from the origin to the X and
Y reference points. This gives us the dimensions of the sprite
in normalized device coordinates.</p>

<ul>
sx = | <b>x</b>''/x''<sub>w</sub> - <b>o</b>''/o''<sub>w</sub> |<br>
sy = | <b>y</b>''/y''<sub>w</sub> - <b>o</b>''/o''<sub>w</sub> |
</ul>

<p>These dimensions are used when testing the sprite for an
intersection with a pick ray. For rendering the sprite, we
need to apply the viewport transformation (see Graphics3D)
to obtain the final on-screen size in pixels:</p>

<ul>
w = 0.5 sx w<sub>vp</sub><br>
h = 0.5 sy h<sub>vp</sub>
</ul>

<p>where w<sub>vp</sub> and h<sub>vp</sub> are the dimensions of the
viewport.</p>

<p class="new">The pixels within the crop rectangle are mapped onto
the resulting rectangle. If both the crop width and height are
positive, then the top left pixel of the crop rectangle maps to the
top left pixel of the rectangle as displayed. Negating the height or
width will flip or mirror the sprite as described in
<code>setCrop</code>.</p>

<p>Note that this formula may produce unintuitive results if the
modelview matrix <b>M</b> incorporates, for example, non-uniform
scaling and/or skewing components. However, the size computation
is well-defined and predictable.</p>

<p>Also note that in the equations above, we transform and project
the X and Y axes of the sprite node as two homogeneous points each;
implementations may obtain the same result by transforming them
differently.</p>

<DL>
<DD><p>Sets a cropping rectangle within the source image. This
 allows a subsection of the image to be used as the source for
 the pixels of the sprite. This can be used for selection of
 individual frames of animation, scrolling of captions, or other
 effects.</p>

 <p>The position of the upper left corner of the crop rectangle
 is given in pixels, relative to the upper left corner of the
 Image2D. Note that the relative position may be negative in
 either or both axes.</p>

 <p>If the crop rectangle has zero width or height, the sprite
 is not rendered or picked. If, on the other hand, the width
 and/or height are negative, the sprite image is flipped in the
 X and/or Y axes, respectively. Note that the crop rectangle
 remains in the same position within the source image regardless
 of the signs of the width and height; only the drawing order of
 the pixels is changed.</p>
     
 <p>The absolute values of the crop width and height are limited
 to an implementation defined maximum that can be queried from
 Graphics3D.</p>

 <p>Wrapping of the source image is not supported. If the crop
 rectangle lies completely or partially outside of the image
 boundaries, the (imaginary) pixels outside of the image are
 treated as if failing the alpha test. In other words, they
 are not rendered, but the on-screen size and pixel zoom factor
 of the sprite remain the same as if the crop rectangle were
 completely inside the image.</p>
