<P>
<P>
 The <code>PushRegistry</code> maintains a list of inbound connections. An application can register the inbound
 connections with an entry in the application descriptor file or dynamically by calling the
 <code>registerConnection</code> method.
 <P> While an application is running, it is responsible for all I/O operations associated with the inbound connection.
 When the application is not running, the application management software(AMS) listens for inbound notification
 requests. When a notification arrives for a registered <code>MIDlet</code>, the AMS will start the <code>MIDlet</code>
 via the normal invocation of <code>MIDlet.startApp</code> method.</P>

 <H3> Installation Handling of Declared Connections </H3>

 <P> To avoid collisions on inbound generic connections, the application descriptor file MUST include information about static connections
 that are needed by the <code>MIDlet</code> suite.

 If all the static Push declarations in the application descriptor can not be fulfilled during the installation, the user MUST be
 notified that there are conflicts and the MIDlet suite MUST NOT be installed. (See <em>Over The Air User Initiated Provisioning 
 Specification</em> section for errors reported in the event of conflicts.) 

 Conditions when the declarations can not be fulfilled include: syntax errors in the Push attributes, declaration for a connection end point (e.g. port
 number) that is already reserved in the device, declaration for a protocol that is not supported for Push in the device, declaration
 referencing a <code>MIDlet</code> class that is not valid and declaration referencing a <code>MIDlet</code> class that is not listed in 
 the <code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;</code> attributes of the same application descriptor.  

 If the <code>MIDlet</code> suite can function meaningfully even if a Push registration can't be
 fulfilled, it MUST register the Push connections using the dynamic registration methods in the <code>PushRegistry</code>.
 </P>
 <P> A conflict-free installation reserves each requested connection for the exclusive use of the
 <code>MIDlets</code> in the suite. While the suite is installed, any attempt by other applications to open one of the
 reserved connections will fail with a <code>ConnectionNotFoundException</code>. A call from a
 <code>MIDlet</code> to <code>Connector.open()</code> on a connection reserved for its suite will always
 succeed, assuming the suite does not already have the connection open.
 </P>

 <P>
 If two <code>MIDlet</code> suites have a static push connection in common, they cannot be installed together and both function
 correctly. The end user would typically have to uninstall one before being able to successfully install the other.
 </P>
 <H3> <A NAME="PushAttr"></A>Push Registration Attribute </H3>
 <P>
 Each push registration entry contains the following information :
 <CODE><BLOCKQUOTE>
 <strong>MIDlet-Push-</strong>&lt;n&gt;: &lt;ConnectionURL&gt;,
      &lt;MIDletClassName&gt;, &lt;AllowedSender&gt;
 </BLOCKQUOTE>
 </CODE>  where :
 <UL>
 <LI> <code>MIDlet-Push-&lt;n&gt;</code> =
    the Push registration attribute name. Multiple push registrations can be provided in a <code>MIDlet</code>
    suite. The numeric value for &lt;n&gt; starts from 1 and MUST use consecutive ordinal numbers for additional entries.
    No gaps are allowed in the numbering.
 </LI>
 <LI><code>ConnectionURL</code> =
    the connection string used in <code>Connector.open()</code></LI>
 <LI><code>MIDletClassName</code> =
   the <code>MIDlet</code> that is responsible for the connection. The named <code>MIDlet</code> MUST be registered in the
   descriptor file or the jar file manifest with a <code>MIDlet-&lt;n&gt;</code> record.
   (This information is needed when displaying messages to the user about the application when push connections are detected,
   or when the user grants/revokes priveleges for the application.) If the named <code>MIDlet</code> appears more than once in the
   suite, the first matching entry is used.  </LI>
 <LI>
 <code>AllowedSender</code> = a designated filter that restricts which senders are valid for launching the requested <code>MIDlet</code>.

 The syntax and semantics of the <code>AllowedSender</code> field depend on the addressing format used for the protocol. 

 However, every syntax for this field MUST support using the wildcard characters "*" and "?". The semantics of those wildcard are:
 <UL>
   <LI> "*" matches any string, including an empty string </LI>
   <LI> "?" matches any single character </LI>
 </UL>
 When the value of this field is just the wildcard character "*", connections will be accepted from any originating source.

 For Push attributes using the <CODE>datagram</CODE> and <CODE>socket</CODE> URLs (if supported by the platform), this field
 contains a numeric IP address in the same format for IPv4 and IPv6 as used in the respective URLs (IPv6 address including the square brackets as in the URL).

 It is possible to use the wildcards also in these IP addresses, e.g. "129.70.40.*" would allow subnet resolution.  Note that the port
 number is not part of the filter for <CODE>datagram</CODE> and <CODE>socket</CODE> connections.
 </LI>
 </UL>
 <P>
 The MIDP 2.0 specification defines the syntax for
 <code>datagram</code> and <code>socket</code> inbound
 connections. When other specifications
 define push semantics for additional connection types, they
 must define the expected syntax for the filter field, as well as
 the expected format for the connection URL string.
 </P>
 <H4> Example Descriptor File Declarative Notation </H4>

 <P>
 The following is a sample descriptor file entry that would reserve
 a stream socket at port 79 and a datagram connection at
 port 50000. (Port numbers are maintained by IANA
 and cover well-known, user-registered and dynamic port numbers)
 [See <a href="http://www.iana.org/numbers.html#P">
 IANA Port Number Registry</a>]
 </P>

 <CODE>
 <PRE>
  MIDlet-Push-1: socket://:79, com.sun.example.SampleChat, *
  MIDlet-Push-2: datagram://:50000, com.sun.example.SampleChat, *
 </PRE>
 </CODE>
 <H3> Buffered Messages </H3>
 <P>
 The requirements for buffering of messages are specific
 to each protocol used for Push and are defined separately
 for each protocol. There is no general requirement related
 to buffering that would apply to all protocols. If the
 implementation buffers messages, these messages MUST
 be provided to the <code>MIDlet</code> when the 
 <code>MIDlet</code> is started and it opens the related
 <code>Connection</code> that it has registered for Push.
 </P>
 <P>
 When datagram connections are supported with Push, the
 implementation MUST guarantee that when a <code>MIDlet</code>
 registered for datagram Push is started in response to an incoming
 datagram, at least the datagram that caused the startup of the
 <code>MIDlet</code> is buffered by the implementation and will be
 available to the <code>MIDlet</code> when the <code>MIDlet</code>
 opens the <code>UDPDatagramConnection</code> after startup.
 </P>
 <P>
 When socket connections are supported with Push, the
 implementation MUST guarantee that when a <code>MIDlet</code>
 registered for socket Push is started in response to
 an incoming socket connection, this connection can
 be accepted by the <code>MIDlet</code> by opening the
 <code>ServerSocketConnection</code> after startup, provided
 that the connection hasn't timed out meanwhile.
 </P>

 <H3> Connection vs Push Registration Support </H3>
 <P>
 Not all generic connections will be appropriate for use
 as push application transport. Even if a protocol is supported
 on the device as an inbound connection type, it is not required
 to be enabled as a valid push mechanism. e.g. a platform might
 support server socket connections in a <code>MIDlet</code>,
 but might not support inbound socket connections for push
 launch capability.
 A <code>ConnectionNotFoundException</code> is thrown from 
 the <code>registerConnection</code> and from the 
 <code>registerAlarm</code> methods, when the platform
 does not support that optional capability.
 </P>

 <H3> AMS Connection Handoff </H3>
 <P>
 Responsibility for registered push connections is shared between
 the AMS and the <code>MIDlet</code> that handles the I/O
 operations on the inbound connection. To prevent any data
 from being lost, an application is responsible for
 all I/O operations on the connection from the time it calls
 <code>Connector.open()</code>
 until it calls <code>Connection.close()</code>.
 </P>
 <P>
 The AMS listens for inbound connection notifications. This
 MAY be handled via a native callback or polling mechanism
 looking for new inbound data. The AMS is
 responsible for presenting the notification to the user.
 The user MUST be given an opportunity to grant or reject
 the notification prior to launching the
 registered <code>MIDlet</code>.
 The AMS MAY record the user's decision to launch the
 application and MAY offer to apply that decision to future
 push notifications. If the AMS supports the capability
 to automatically launch a <code>MIDlet</code>, then it MUST also
 support a mechanism to cancel that feature at a later
 time. e.g. the decision to automate handling of push
 content can be retracted by the user.
 </P>
 <P>
 The AMS is responsible for the shutdown of any running
 applications (if necessary) prior to the invocation of
 the push <code>MIDlet</code> method.
 </P>
 <P>
 After the AMS has started the push application, the
 <code>MIDlet</code> is responsible for opening the
 connections and for all subsequent I/O operations.
 An application that needs to perform blocking I/O
 operations SHOULD use a separate thread to allow
 for interactive user operations.
 Once the application has been started and the connection
 has been opened, the AMS is no longer responsible for
 listening for push notifications for that connection.
 The application is
 responsible for reading all inbound data.
 </P>
 <P>
 If an application has finished with all inbound data
 it MAY <code>close()</code> the connection.
 If the connection is closed,
 then neither the AMS nor the application
 will be listening for push notifications. Inbound data
 could be lost, if the application closes the connection
 before all data has been received.
 </P>
 <P>
 When the application is destroyed, the AMS resumes its
 responsiblity to watch for inbound connections.
 </P>
 <P>
 A push application SHOULD behave in a predictable manner
 when handling asynchronous data via the push mechanism.
 A well behaved application SHOULD inform the user that
 data has been processed. (While it is possible to write
 applications that do not use any user visible interfaces,
 this could lead to a confused end user experience to
 launch an application that only performs a background
 function.)
 </P>
 <H3>Dynamic Connections Registered from a Running MIDlet</H3>

 <P>
 There are cases when defining a well known port registered
 with IANA is not necessary.
 Simple applications may just wish to exchange data using a private
 protocol between a <code>MIDlet</code> and server application.
 </P>

 <P>
 To accomodate this type of application, a mechanism is provided
 to dynamically allocate a connection and to register
 that information, as if it was known, when the application was
 installed. This information can then be sent to an agent on the network to
 use as the mechanism to communicate with the registered
 <code>MIDlet</code>.
 </P>
 <P>
 For instance, if a <a href="UDPDatagramConnection.html">
 <code>UDPDatagramConnection</code></a>
 is opened and a port number,
 was not specified, then the application is
 requesting a dynamic port
 to be allocated from the ports that are currently available. By
 calling <code>PushRegistry.registerConnection()</code> the
 <code>MIDlet</code> informs the AMS that it is the target for
 inbound communication, even
 after the <code>MIDlet</code> has been destroyed (See
 <code>MIDlet</code> life cycle for
 definition of "destroyed" state). If the application is deleted from the
 phone, then its dynamic communication connections are unregistered
 automatically.
 </P>
 <H3>AMS Runtime Handling - Implementation Notes</H3>

 <P>
 During installation each <code>MIDlet</code> that is expecting
 inbound communication
 on a well known address has the information recorded with the
 AMS from the push registration attribute in the manifest or
 application descriptor file. Once the installation has been
 successfully completed,
 (e.g. For the OTA recommended practices - when the <em>Installation
 notification message</em> has been successfully transmitted, the
 application is officially installed.)
 the <code>MIDlet</code> MAY then receive inbound communication.
 e.g. the push notification event.
 </P>

 <P>
 When the AMS is started, it checks the list of registered
 connections  and  begins listening for inbound communication.
 When a notification arrives the AMS starts the registered
 <code>MIDlet</code>.
 The <code>MIDlet</code> then opens
 the connection with <code>Connector.open()</code> method to
 perform whatever I/O operations are needed for the particular
 connection type. e.g. for a server socket the application
 uses <code>acceptAndOpen()</code> to get the socket connected
 and for a datagram connection the application uses
 <code>receive()</code> to read the delivered message.
 </P>
 <P>
 For message oriented transports the inbound message MAY be
 read by the AMS and saved for delivery to the <code>MIDlet</code>
 when it requests to read the data. For stream oriented transports
 the connection MAY be lost if the connection is not
 accepted before the server end of the connection request
 timeouts.
 </P>
 <P>
 When a <code>MIDlet</code> is started in response to a registered
 push connection notification, it is platform dependent what
 happens to the current running application. The <code>MIDlet</code>
 life cycle defines the expected behaviors that an interrupted
 <code>MIDlet</code> could see from a call to <code>pauseApp()</code>
 or from <code>destroyApp()</code>.
 </P>

 <H3>RIM Implementation Notes</H3>
 <P>
 RIM only supports the use of the <code>registerAlarm()</code> method with
 <code>time</code> values up to 30 hours in the future. Any MIDlets that
 register an alarm with <code>time</code> values greater than 30 hours in
 the future will be started in 30 hours, at which point they can register for
 a new alarm.
 </P>

 <H2>Sample Usage Scenarios</H2>
 <P>
 <strong>Usage scenario 1:</strong>
 The suite includes a <code>MIDlet</code> with a well
 known port for communication.
 During the <code>startApp</code> processing
 a thread is launched to handle the incoming data.
 Using a separate thread is the recommended practice
 for avoiding conflicts between blocking I/O operations
 and the normal user interaction events. The
 thread continues to receive messages until the
 <code>MIDlet</code> is destroyed.
 </P>

 <H4>Sample Chat Descriptor File -</H4>
 <P> In this sample, the descriptor file includes
 a static push
 connection registration. It also includes
 an indication that this <code>MIDlet</code>
 requires permission to use a datagram connection
 for inbound push messages.
 <strong>Note:</strong> this sample is appropriate for bursts of
 datagrams.
 It is written to loop on the connection, processing
 received messages.
