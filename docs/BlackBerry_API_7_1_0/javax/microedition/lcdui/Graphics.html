<P>
<p>Provides simple 2D geometric rendering capability.

 <p>Drawing primitives are provided for text, images, lines, rectangles,
 and arcs. Rectangles and arcs may also be filled with a solid color.
 Rectangles may also be specified with rounded corners. <p>

 <p>The only drawing operation provided is pixel replacement. The
 destination pixel value is simply replaced by the current
 pixel value specified in the graphics object being used for
 rendering. No facility for combining pixel values, such as
 raster-ops or alpha blending, is provided. <p>

 <p>A 24-bit color model is provided, with 8 bits for each of red, green, and
 blue components of a color. Not all devices support a full 24 bits' worth
 of color and thus they will map colors requested by the application into
 colors available on the device. Facilities are provided in the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Display.html" title="class in javax.microedition.lcdui"><CODE>Display</CODE></A> class for obtaining device characteristics, such as
 whether color is available and how many distinct gray levels are available.
 This enables applications to adapt their behavior to a device without
 compromising device independence. <p>

 <p>For all rendering operations, source pixels are always 
 combined with destination pixels using the Source Over 
 Destination rule [Porter-Duff]. Other schemes for 
 combining source pixels with destination pixels, such 
 as raster-ops, are not provided.
 
 <p>For the text, line, rectangle, and arc drawing and 
 filling primitives, the source pixel is a pixel 
 representing the current color of the graphics object 
 being used for rendering. This pixel is always considered
 to be fully opaque. With source pixel that is always
 fully opaque, the Source Over Destination rule has the 
 effect of pixel replacement, where destination pixels are 
 simply replaced with the source pixel from the graphics object.
 
 <p>The <code>drawImage()</code> and <code>drawRegion()</code> methods use an image as the source 
 for rendering operations instead of the current color of the 
 graphics object. In this context, the Source Over Destination
  rule has the following properties: a fully opaque pixel in 
 the source must replace the destination pixel, a fully 
 transparent pixel in the source must leave the destination 
 pixel unchanged, and a semitransparent pixel in the source 
 must be alpha blended with the destination pixel. Alpha 
 blending of semitransparent pixels is required. If an implementation 
 does not support alpha blending, it must remove all 
 semitransparency from image source data at the time the image 
 is created. See Alpha Processing for further discussion.
 
 <p>The destinations of all graphics rendering are considered to consist
 entirely of fully opaque pixels. A property of the Source Over 
 Destination rule is that compositing any pixel with a fully 
 opaque destination pixel always results in a fully opaque destination
 pixel. This has the effect of confining full and partial transparency
 to immutable images, which may only be used as the source for rendering operations.
 <p>Graphics may be rendered directly to the display or to an off-screen
 image buffer. The destination of rendered graphics depends on the
 provenance of the graphics object. A graphics object for rendering
 to the display is passed to the Canvas object's
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas.html#paint(javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics)"><CODE>paint()</CODE></A>
 method. This is the only means by which a graphics object may
 be obtained whose destination is the display. Furthermore, applications
 may draw using this graphics object only for the duration of the
 paint() method. <p>

 <p>A graphics object for rendering to an off-screen image buffer may
 be obtained by calling the
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Image.html#getGraphics()"><CODE>getGraphics()</CODE></A>
 method on the desired image.
 A graphics object so obtained may be held indefinitely
 by the application, and requests may be issued on this graphics
 object at any time. <p>

 <p>The default coordinate system's origin is at the
 upper left-hand corner of the destination. The X-axis direction is
 positive towards the right, and the Y-axis direction is positive
 downwards. Applications may assume that horizontal and vertical
 distances in the coordinate system represent equal distances on the
 actual device display, that is, pixels are square. A facility is provided
 for translating the origin of the coordinate system.
 All coordinates are specified as integers. <p>

 <p>The coordinate system represents locations between pixels, not the
 pixels themselves. Therefore, the first pixel in the upper left corner
 of the display lies in the square bounded by coordinates
 (0,0) , (1,0) , (0,1) , (1,1). <p>

 <p>Under this definition, the semantics for fill operations are clear.
 Since coordinate grid lines lie between pixels, fill operations
 affect pixels that lie entirely within the region bounded by the
 coordinates of the operation. For example, the operation
 <pre>
    g.fillRect(0, 0, 3, 2)
 </pre>
 paints exactly six pixels.  (In this example, and in all subsequent 
 examples, the variable <code>g</code> is assumed to contain a reference to a 
 Graphics object.) <p>

 <p>Each character of a font contains a set of pixels that forms the shape of
 the character.  When a character is painted, the pixels forming the
 character's shape are filled with the Graphics object's current color, and
 the pixels not part of the character's shape are left untouched.
 The text drawing calls
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Graphics.html#drawChar(char, int, int, int)"><CODE>drawChar()</CODE></A>,
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Graphics.html#drawChars(char[], int, int, int, int, int)"><CODE>drawChars()</CODE></A>,
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Graphics.html#drawString(java.lang.String, int, int, int)"><CODE>drawString()</CODE></A>, and
 <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Graphics.html#drawSubstring(java.lang.String, int, int, int, int, int)"><CODE>drawSubstring()</CODE></A>
 all draw text in this manner. <p>

 <p>Lines, arcs, rectangles, and rounded rectangles may be drawn with either a
 SOLID or a DOTTED stroke style, as set by the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Graphics.html#setStrokeStyle(int)"><CODE>setStrokeStyle()</CODE></A> method.  The stroke style does not affect fill, text, and
 image operations. <p>
 
 <p>For the SOLID stroke style,
 drawing operations are performed with a one-pixel wide pen that fills
 the pixel immediately
 below and to the right of the specified coordinate. Drawn lines
 touch pixels at both endpoints. Thus, the operation
 <pre>
    g.drawLine(0, 0, 0, 0)
 </pre>
 paints exactly one pixel, the first pixel in the upper left corner
 of the display. <p>

 <p>Drawing operations under the DOTTED stroke style will touch a subset of 
 pixels that would have been touched under the SOLID stroke style.  The 
 frequency and length of dots is implementation-dependent.  The endpoints of 
 lines and arcs are not guaranteed to be drawn, nor are the corner points of 
 rectangles guaranteed to be drawn.  Dots are drawn by painting with the 
 current color; spaces between dots are left untouched. <p>

 <p>An artifact of the coordinate system is that the area affected by a fill
 operation differs slightly from the area affected by a draw operation given
 the same coordinates. For example, consider the operations
 <pre>
    g.fillRect(x, y, w, h); // 1
    g.drawRect(x, y, w, h); // 2
 </pre>
 Statement (1) fills a rectangle w pixels wide and h pixels high.
 Statement (2) draws a rectangle whose left and top
 edges are within the area filled by statement (1). However, the
 bottom and right edges lie one pixel outside the filled area.
 This is counterintuitive, but it preserves the invariant that
 <pre>
    g.drawLine(x, y, x+w, y);
    g.drawLine(x+w, y, x+w, y+h);
    g.drawLine(x+w, y+h, x, y+h);
    g.drawLine(x, y+h, x, y);
 </pre>
 has an effect identical to statement (2) above. <p>

 <p>The exact pixels painted by drawLine() and drawArc() are not
 specified. Pixels touched by a fill operation must either
 exactly overlap or directly abut pixels touched by the
 corresponding draw operation. A fill operation must never leave
 a gap between the filled area and the pixels touched by the
 corresponding draw operation, nor may the fill operation touch
 pixels outside the area bounded by the corresponding draw operation. <p>

 <a name="CLIP"></a>
 <h3>Clipping</h3>
 
 <p>The clip is the set of pixels in the destination of the Graphics
 object that may be modified by graphics rendering operations.
 
 <p>There is a single clip per Graphics object. The only pixels 
 modified by graphics operations are those that lie within
  the clip. Pixels outside the clip are not modified by 
 any graphics operations.
 
 <p>Operations are provided for intersecting the current clip 
 with a given rectangle and for setting the current clip 
 outright. The application may specify the clip by supplying 
 a clip rectangle using coordinates relative to the current 
 coordinate system.
 
 <p>It is legal to specify a clip rectangle whose width or height
  is zero or negative. In this case the clip is considered to 
 be empty, that is, no pixels are contained within it. Therefore, 
 if any graphics operations are issued under such a clip, no 
 pixels will be modified.
 
 <p>It is legal to specify a clip rectangle that extends 
 beyond or resides entirely beyond the bounds of the 
 destination. No pixels exist outside the bounds of the 
 destination, and the area of the clip rectangle that is 
 outside the destination is ignored. Only the pixels that 
 lie both within the destination and within the specified 
 clip rectangle are considered to be part of the clip.
 
 <p>Operations on the coordinate system, such as translate(),
  do not modify the clip. The methods getClipX(), getClipY(),
  getClipWidth() and getClipHeight() must return a rectangle
  that, if passed to setClip without an intervening change to
  the Graphics object's coordinate system, must result in the
  identical set of pixels in the clip. The rectangle returned
  from the getClip family of methods may differ from the clip
  rectangle that was requested in setClip(). This can occur if
  the coordinate system has been changed or if the implementation
  has chosen to intersect the clip rectangle with the bounds of
  the destination of the Graphics object. 

 <p>If a graphics operation is affected by the clip rectangle, the pixels
 touched by that operation must be the same ones that would be touched
 as if the clip rectangle did not affect the operation. For example,
 consider a clip rectangle (cx, cy, cw, ch) and a point (x1, y1) that
 lies outside this rectangle and a point (x2, y2) that lies within this
 rectangle. In the following code fragment,
 <pre>
    g.setClip(0, 0, canvas.getWidth(), canvas.getHeight());
    g.drawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2); // 3
    g.setClip(cx, cy, cw, ch);
    g.drawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2); // 4
 </pre>
 
 <p>The pixels touched by statement (4) must be identical to the pixels
 within (cx, cy, cw, ch) touched by statement (3). <p>

 <a name="anchor"></a>
 <h3>Anchor Points</h3> <p>

 <p>The drawing of text is based on "anchor points".
 Anchor points are used to minimize the amount of
 computation required when placing text.
 For example, in order to center a piece of text,
 an application needs to call stringWidth() or
 charWidth() to get the width and then perform a
 combination of subtraction and division to
 compute the proper location.
 The method to draw text is defined as follows:
 <pre>
    public void drawString(String text, int x, int y, int anchor);
 </pre>
 <p>This method draws text in the current color,
 using the current font
 with its anchor point at (x,y). The definition
 of the anchor point must be one of the
 horizontal constants (LEFT, HCENTER, RIGHT)
 combined with one of the vertical constants
 (TOP, BASELINE, BOTTOM) using the logical OR operator. <p>

 <p>Vertical centering of the text is not specified since it is not considered
 useful, it is hard to specify, and it is burdensome to implement. Thus,
 the VCENTER value is not allowed in the anchor point parameter of text
 drawing calls. <p>

 <p>The actual position of the bounding box
 of the text relative to the (x, y) location is
 determined by the anchor point. These anchor
 points occur at named locations along the
 outer edge of the bounding box. Thus, if <code>f</code>
 is <code>g</code>'s current font (as returned by
 <code>g.getFont()</code>, the following calls will all have
 identical results:
 <pre>
    g.drawString(str, x, y, TOP|LEFT);
    g.drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str)/2, y, TOP|HCENTER);
    g.drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str), y, TOP|RIGHT);

    g.drawString(str, x,
        y + f.getBaselinePosition(), BASELINE|LEFT);
    g.drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str)/2,
        y + f.getBaselinePosition(), BASELINE|HCENTER);
    g.drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str),
        y + f.getBaselinePosition(), BASELINE|RIGHT);

    drawString(str, x,
        y + f.getHeight(), BOTTOM|LEFT);
    drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str)/2,
        y + f.getHeight(), BOTTOM|HCENTER);
    drawString(str, x + f.stringWidth(str),
        y + f.getHeight(), BOTTOM|RIGHT);
 </pre> <p>

 <p>For text drawing, the inter-character and inter-line spacing (leading)
 specified by the font designer are included as part of the values returned
 in the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Font.html#stringWidth(java.lang.String)"><CODE>stringWidth()</CODE></A> and <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Font.html#getHeight()"><CODE>getHeight()</CODE></A> 
 calls of class <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Font.html" title="class in javax.microedition.lcdui"><CODE>Font</CODE></A>.
 For example, given the following code:
 <pre>
    // (5)
    g.drawString(string1+string2, x, y, TOP|LEFT);

    // (6)
    g.drawString(string1, x, y, TOP|LEFT);
    g.drawString(string2, x + f.stringWidth(string1), y, TOP|LEFT);
 </pre>
 <p>Code fragments (5) and (6) behave identically. This
 occurs because f.stringWidth()
 includes the inter-character spacing.
 <p>Similarly, reasonable vertical spacing may be
 achieved simply by adding the font height
 to the Y-position of subsequent lines. For example:
 <pre>
    g.drawString(string1, x, y, TOP|LEFT);
    g.drawString(string2, x, y + f.fontHeight(), TOP|LEFT);
 </pre>
 draws string1 and string2 on separate lines with
 an appropriate amount of inter-line spacing. <p>

 <p>The stringWidth() of the string and the fontHeight() of the font in which
 it is drawn define the size of the bounding box of a piece of text. As
 described above, this box includes inter-line and inter-character spacing.
 The implementation is required to put this space below and to right of the
 pixels actually belonging to the characters drawn. Applications that wish
 to position graphics closely with respect text (for example, to paint a
 rectangle around a string of text) may assume that there is space below and
 to the right of a string and that there is <em>no</em> space above and to the
 left of the string. <p>

 <p>Anchor points are also used for positioning of images. Similar to text
 drawing, the anchor point for an image specifies the point on the bounding
 rectangle of the destination that is to positioned at the (x,y) location
 given in the graphics request. Unlike text, vertical centering of images
 is well-defined, and thus the VCENTER value may be used within the anchor
 point parameter of image drawing requests. Because images have no notion
 of a baseline, the BASELINE value may not be used within the anchor point
 parameter of image drawing requests.

<DD>Fills a circular or elliptical arc covering the specified rectangle.
 <p>
 The resulting arc begins at <code>startAngle</code> and extends
 for <code>arcAngle</code> degrees.
 Angles are interpreted such that 0 degrees
 is at the 3 o'clock position.
 A positive value indicates a counter-clockwise rotation
 while a negative value indicates a clockwise rotation.
 <p>
 The center of the arc is the center of the rectangle whose origin
 is (<em>x</em>,&nbsp;<em>y</em>) and whose size is specified by the
 <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> arguments.
 <p>
 If either width or height is zero or less,
 nothing is drawn.

 <p> The filled region consists of the "pie wedge" region bounded by the arc
 segment as if drawn by drawArc(), the radius extending from the center to
 this arc at <code>startAngle</code> degrees, and radius extending from the
 center to this arc at <code>startAngle + arcAngle</code> degrees. </p>

 <p> The angles are specified relative to the non-square extents of
 the bounding rectangle such that 45 degrees always falls on the
 line from the center of the ellipse to the upper right corner of
 the bounding rectangle. As a result, if the bounding rectangle is
 noticeably longer in one axis than the other, the angles to the

<DL>
<DD>Renders a series of device-independent RGB+transparency values in a
 specified region.  The values are stored in
 <code>rgbData</code> in a format
 with <code>24</code> bits of RGB and an eight-bit alpha value
 (<code>0xAARRGGBB</code>),
 with the first value stored at the specified offset.  The
 <code>scanlength</code>
 specifies the relative offset within the array between the
 corresponding pixels of consecutive rows.  Any value for
 <code>scanlength</code> is acceptable (even negative values)
 provided that all resulting references are within the
 bounds of the <code>rgbData</code> array. The ARGB data is
 rasterized horizontally from left to right within each row.
 The ARGB values are
 rendered in the region specified by <code>x</code>,
 <code>y</code>, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, and
 the operation is subject to the current clip region
 and translation for this <code>Graphics</code> object.

 <p>Consider <code>P(a,b)</code> to be the value of the pixel
 located at column <code>a</code> and row <code>b</code> of the
 Image, where rows and columns are numbered downward from the
 top starting at zero, and columns are numbered rightward from
 the left starting at zero. This operation can then be defined
 as:</p>

 <TABLE BORDER="2">
 <TR>
 <TD ROWSPAN="1" COLSPAN="1">
    <pre><code>
    P(a, b) = rgbData[offset + (a - x) + (b - y) * scanlength]       </code></pre>
 </TD>
 </TR>
 </TABLE>

 <p> for </p>

 <TABLE BORDER="2">
 <TR>
 <TD ROWSPAN="1" COLSPAN="1">
    <pre><code>
     x &lt;= a &lt; x + width
     y &lt;= b &lt; y + height    </code></pre>
 </TD>
 </TR>
 </TABLE>
 <p> This capability is provided in the <code>Graphics</code>
 class so that it can be
 used to render both to the screen and to offscreen
 <code>Image</code> objects.  The
 ability to retrieve ARGB values is provided by the <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Image.html#getRGB(int[], int, int, int, int, int, int)"><CODE>Image.getRGB(int[], int, int, int, int, int, int)</CODE></A>
 method. </p>

 <p> If <code>processAlpha</code> is <code>true</code>, the
 high-order byte of the ARGB format
 specifies opacity; that is, <code>0x00RRGGBB</code> specifies a
 fully transparent
 pixel and <code>0xFFRRGGBB</code> specifies a fully opaque
 pixel.  Intermediate
 alpha values specify semitransparency.  If the implementation does not
 support alpha blending for image rendering operations, it must remove
 any semitransparency from the source data prior to performing any
 rendering.  (See <a href="Image.html#alpha">Alpha Processing</a> for
 further discussion.)
 If <code>processAlpha</code> is <code>false</code>, the alpha
 values are ignored and all pixels
 must be treated as completely opaque.</p>

 <p> The mapping from ARGB values to the device-dependent
 pixels is platform-specific and may require significant
 computation.</p>

<DL>
<DD>Gets the color that will be displayed if the specified color
 is requested. This method enables the developer to check the
 manner in which RGB values are mapped to the set of distinct 
 colors that the device can actually display. For example, 
 with a monochrome device, this method will return either
 <code>0xFFFFFF</code> (white) or <code>0x000000</code> (black) 
 depending on the brightness of the specified color.
