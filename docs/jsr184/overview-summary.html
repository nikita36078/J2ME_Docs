<h1>Overview</h1>
<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>This document contains the specification of the Mobile 3D Graphics
API (abbreviated "M3G") for the Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition
("J2ME").
The specification was defined within the Java Community Process ("JCP")
under Java Specification Request 184 ("JSR-184"). The specification is
subject to the terms of the JCP agreements (i.e. JSPA and/or IEPA).
</p>
<p>The Mobile 3D Graphics API is an <i>optional package</i>. An
optional package can be adopted to existing J2ME <i>profiles</i>.
A profile of J2ME defines device-type-specific sets of APIs for a
particular vertical market or industry. The main target platform of
this optional API is J2ME/CLDC, used with profiles such as MIDP 1.0 or
MIDP 2.0. However, the API can also be implemented on top of J2ME/CDC,
or any Java platform in general.
</p>
<p>Technical details of the API can be found in the <a
 href="javax/microedition/m3g/package-summary.html">package
overview</a> and the individual class descriptions; see especially the
<a href="javax/microedition/m3g/Graphics3D.html">Graphics3D</a>
class. To see how the API is used in practice, refer to the <a
 href="javax/microedition/m3g/package-summary.html#ExampleMidlets">example
MIDlets</a> at the end of the Package overview.
</p>
<p>This specification uses definitions based upon those specified in
RFC 2119 (available on the <a href="http://www.ietf.org">IETF web
site</a>).

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The objective of the Mobile 3D Graphics API Expert Group was to
provide an efficient 3D Graphics API suitable for the J2ME platform,
in particular CLDC/MIDP. The API is targeted at CLDC class of devices
that typically have very little processing power and memory, and no
hardware support for 3D graphics or floating point math. The API has
been defined such that implementations on that kind of hardware are
feasible. However, the API also scales up to higher-end devices
featuring a color display, a DSP, a floating point unit, or even
specialized 3D graphics hardware.
</p>
<p>The M3G specification is based on the requirements, summarized
below,
that were agreed on by the Expert Group. The rationale for each
requirement
is presented in the paragraphs following the summary.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The API <b>must </b>support retained mode access (that is, a
scene
graph).</li>
  <li>The API <b>must </b>support immediate mode access, with
features
similar
to OpenGL.</li>
  <li>The API <b>must</b> support mixing and matching of immediate and
retained
mode access.</li>
  <li>The API <b>must not</b> include optional parts (that is, all
methods
must
be implemented).</li>
  <li>The API <b>must</b> have importers for meshes, textures, entire
scene
graphs,
etc.</li>
  <li>The API <b>must</b> be efficiently implementable on top of
OpenGL ES.</li>
  <li>The API <b>must</b> use the native float data type of Java, not
introduce
a custom type.</li>
  <li>The API <b>must </b>be efficiently implementable without
floating
point
hardware.</li>
  <li>The API <b>should</b> be implementable within 150 kB on a real
mobile
terminal.</li>
  <li>The API <b>must</b> be structured so that garbage collection is
minimized.</li>
  <li>The API <b>must</b> be interoperable with related Java APIs,
especially
with MIDP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several applications were identified for the Mobile 3D Graphics API,
including games, map visualization, user interfaces, animated
messages, product visualization, and screen savers. Each of these have
different needs: some require simple content creation, some require
high polygon throughput, yet others require high quality still images
with special effects.
</p>
<p>It is clear that such a wide spectrum of different needs cannot be
fulfilled by a scene graph API alone, nor an immediate mode API
alone. It is also clear that having two separate APIs would lead to
developer confusion and sub-optimal usage of precious memory
space. Rather, there must be only one indivisible API, with only one
RI and TCK, that covers both types of access in a unified way. A
developer should be able to use either one, or both at the same time,
depending on the task at hand.
</p>
<p>The immediate mode (or low-level) part of the API should be a
subset of OpenGL with no added functionality. That is, the low-level
features should be compatible with OpenGL ES, which is being
standardized by Khronos. For the Reference Implementation, the scene
graph (or high-level) part must be built on top of the low-level
interface, and shall never bypass it when rendering. This ensures that
the scene graph does not include rendering features that cannot be
implemented directly with the low-level interface. The low-level
implementation may then be changed freely, or even accelerated with
dedicated hardware.
</p>
<p>In many cases, there is little else to an application than
displaying a scene and playing back some animation created in a 3D
modeling tool. This should not require much Java programming. Even in
more demanding cases, it greatly speeds up development if it is easy
to import objects and animations into a midlet. Therefore, the API
must provide importer functions for different data types, such as
textures, meshes, animations, and scene hierarchies. The data must be
encoded in a binary format for compact storage and transmission.
</p>
<p>Most mobile terminals do not have hardware support for floating
point processing. This should be reflected in the API, so that it can
be efficiently implemented using integer arithmetic. However, since
programming with fixed point mathematics is difficult and error prone,
the API should use floating point values wherever feasible, and plain
integers otherwise. Fixed point values must not be used. Also, instead
of introducing a custom Float type or packing floating point values
into integers, Java's built-in float data type must be used. As a
consequence, this API can not be implemented on top of CLDC 1.0.
</p>
<p>Like all APIs targeting MIDP, we need to strive for as compact an
implementation as possible. It should be possible to implement the API
in less than 150 kB of ROM space, including the native graphics
engine, Java class files (ROMized), and content importing
facilities. To minimize garbage collection, the API should be
structured so that using it does not require repetitive creation of
objects.
</p>
<p>The API must be tightly integrated with MIDP's LCDUI, such that 2D
and
3D graphics can be efficiently rendered on the same Canvas or Image,
for
example. The decision of whether to use double buffering or not should
be delegated to the MIDP implementation. The API should also be able to
bind with other GUI APIs, such as AWT.
